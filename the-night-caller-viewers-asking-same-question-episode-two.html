In the second episode, we see Tony go into survival mode as he tries to come to terms with his crime, still haunted by a mysterious event in his past involving a school pupil.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_Kv_5duZ_W data-wc=55>So far, we've seen flashbacks showing a schoolboy struggling in a swimming pool. Then in episode two, Tony recognises a young girl in school uniform while riding the bus. Before getting off at the next stop, the girl sees Tony and looks at him with despair. He quickly mouths, 'I'm sorry,' before she steps off.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/29cfd572424d-robert-glenister-tony-night-caller.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Night Caller viewers saying same thing about Channel 5's new thriller" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/29cfd572424d-robert-glenister-tony-night-caller.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Night Caller viewers saying same thing about Channel 5's new thriller" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Night Caller viewers saying same thing about Channel 5's new thriller</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="11 TV shows that are a total must-watch coming to Netflix in July" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/88b62e654056-cobunit01010r.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="11 TV shows that are a total must-watch coming to Netflix in July" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>11 TV shows that are a total must-watch coming to Netflix in July</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="All Creatures Great and Small cast out of costume: their real-life looks away from the show" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3450889d770a-all-creatures-out-of-costume.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="All Creatures Great and Small cast out of costume: their real-life looks away from the show" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>All Creatures Great and Small cast out of costume: their real-life looks away from the show</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eHcfMMAVcV- data-wc=59>Later in the episode, Tony speaks about his old teaching job whilst on a date with Rosa, revealing that he used to be the head of science and pastoral care. But when Rosa starts talking about the pressure on children these days, suggesting that "lots of them were really struggling", Tony becomes overwhelmed and excuses himself from the table.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAqkqseLEX5 data-wc=58>Taking to social media, viewers were curious to know why Tony got let go from his teaching job. One person wrote: "<strong>Did Tony drown the school kid, or is the kid swimming?</strong> #TheNightCaller," while another asked: "Tony's flashbacks of the young boy in the swimming pool, did he do something to a student when he was a teacher?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28c4a0ddec7a-robert-glenister-night-caller.jpg><p id=eud1tRajYf_ data-wc=29>A third viewer offered a possible theory, penning: "Seems like a child died on his watch. So he was dismissed, and now he lives with the trauma and tragedy."</p><p id=e97pVILS1nt data-wc=19>Ahead of the show's premiere, Robert Glenister, who plays Tony, spoke about his character's bitterness at losing his job.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5342fee3b480-the-night-caller-dj.jpg><p id=erWwc_5NrGk data-wc=117>"He's definitely angry and there's probably a bit of bitterness in there as well, because he was close to retirement and now he has lost his vocation. At the start of the drama, <strong>we don't know why he has lost his job, but he's haunted by images and flashbacks&nbsp;</strong>that the viewer sees," explained Robert. "I was talking to Suzanne Packer, who plays Rosa – she has some teaching experience, and she was telling me how the stress that teachers are under now is just phenomenal. It's the incessant day-to-day graft of maintaining a certain standard, when you might have a classroom of kids who really couldn't give two hoots, I think it must be really tough.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed8b_nQU7SW data-wc=27>"But for Tony, teaching is what he feels he was born to do. Losing that purpose after quite a successful career starts a downward spiral," he added.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew27-HpyHJ_ data-wc=21><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
