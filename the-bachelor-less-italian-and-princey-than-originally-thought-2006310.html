Though <a href=#>ABC's Web site</a> claims he was born in Milan and raised in Connecticut, his parents, <strong>Princess Amanda Borghese</strong> and <strong>Prince Francesco Borghese</strong>, have lived in Short Hills, New Jersey, since 1979, and his permanent addresses prior to 2001 all list him as a resident of the Garden State.</p><p>A source tells Radar that after discovering that Borghese speaks only "menu Italian," the show's producers enrolled Borghese in an intensive Italian language course before filming began. (A spokesman for ABC denies knowledge of the course.)</p><p>The title is real, though it doesn't translate into a castle and throne (titles haven't even been recognized in Italy since 1947).</p><p>The Borghese family is said to be deeply embarrassed by Lorenzo's participation in the show, though his recent foray into the Borghese Cosmetics line hardly bolstered his pedigree.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lorenzo's contribution to the family business? A line of doggie grooming products called Royal Treatment Pet Care, including the Stinky-B-Gone odor fighting kit, the Pumpkin Patch spritz, and the After Bath Pet Robe.
