(The <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a> alum is also the mom of son Isaac, whom she shares with ex <strong>Jo Rivera</strong>, and son Lincoln, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Javi Marroquin</strong></a>. In July 2023, after months of speculation, Lowry subtly confirmed she had <a href=#>welcomed a fifth child</a>.)</p><p>Lowry and Scott began dating not long after he moved into the MTV personality’s Delaware neighborhood, ultimately moving in with Lowry and her four sons the same month they began their relationship.</p><p>Nearly one year after giving fans a glimpse at their romance on a June 2022 episode of Lowry’s <a href=#>“Barely Famous” podcast</a> — during which Lowry said she made the first move and that she and Scott had been together for “three months” — the mom of five revealed that she had welcomed her fifth child in late 2022.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>In October 2023, Lowry<a href=#> finally opened up</a> about welcoming her and Scott’s son, Rio, as well as the “traumatizing” circumstances around his birth. Later that month, she revealed that she and Scott <a href=#>are expecting twins.</a></span></p><p>Keep scrolling to see the full timeline of Lowry and Scott’s romance:</p><h3>April 2022</h3><p>Two years after she and Lopez called off their on-again-off-again relationship, Lowry revealed she was seeing someone new.</p><p>“Me and my boyfriend actually send pictures of Open Vitamins that we take every morning,” she said in a <a href=#>since-deleted Instagram ad</a> for vitamins, referring to her romance with Scott, “He will send me a picture of his and I will send a picture of mine.”</p><p>Not long after, Lopez said he learned of his ex’s relationship status from their sons — and not Lowry herself.</p><p>“It was actually recently where I had to pull my kids’ mom to the side and be like, ‘Yo, there’s no reason why my 4-year-old should be telling me about every dude you sleeping with,’” he said during an April episode of his <a href=#>“P.T.S.D. – Pressure Talks with Single Dads” podcast</a>. “[Lux] was just telling me about this last dude, and now, he’s telling me about the new dude.”</p><h3>May 2022</h3><p>One month later, the MTV personality confirmed her and Scott’s relationship by sharing a pic of their hands together in bed via her Instagram Story. Lowry also revealed via another social media upload that Scott had been introduced to her four children.</p><h3>June 2022</h3><p>Lowry recalled her and Scott’s first fight on an episode of her “Barely Famous” podcast, joking that she needed him to drive faster so that she didn’t have a bathroom accident before meeting his family.</p><p>“I got this crazy pain in my stomach [while we were in the car] and I was like, ‘I need you to go 100 mph.’ And he was like, ‘I can’t, or I’ll lose my license,’” she explained. “I was mortified. I was like, ‘I am not meeting your mom for the first time and almost s—tting myself on her floor.’”</p><p>That same month, Scott made his face debut on Lowry’s Instagram Story as she shared photos and videos of the construction worker in honor of his birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kailyn-Lowry-and-Elijah-Scott-s-Relationship-Timeline-From-First-Moves-to-Instagram-Posts-and-More-201-211.jpg><h3>July 2022</h3><p>Lowry clarified <a href=#>rumors about Scott’s alleged infidelity</a> during an Instagram Story Q&A. After one fan asked, “Was your boyfriend in a relationship when you moved next door to him?” the reality star replied, “Yes but he did not cheat on her. We got together a while after they broke up despite what some are committed to believing.”</p><h3>February 2023</h3><p>Fans began speculating that Lowry was pregnant with her fifth child after Lopez posted a cryptic message via Twitter — in addition to photos of Lowry appearing to be pregnant surfaced online — claiming in the since-deleted tweet that Lowry had to “protect the belly,” according to <a href=#>InTouch</a>.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MEGA909292_001.jpg></p><h3>June 2023</h3><p>Months later, Lowry added fuel to the baby rumors by wishing Scott a Happy Father’s Day via her <a href=#>Instagram Story</a>. “& happy Father’s Day to Lijie cause he’s a Zaddddddddyyyyyyy,” she captioned a since-deleted photo of her boyfriend.</p><h3>July 2023</h3><p>Lowry subtly confirmed on an episode of her and Vee Rivera’s <a href=#>“Baby Mamas No Drama” podcast</a> that she had welcomed her fifth child in late 2022, though she didn’t reveal the father’s identity.</p><p>“I actually watched — I first came across your show [when] I was in the hospital having one of my kids,” she told guest <a href=#><strong>Aurora Culpo</strong></a> while chatting about the reality series The Culpo Sisters, which premiered in November 2022. “The first episode that I saw was, I believe, you told your parents that you were, maybe, separating or divorcing and then one of your sisters was going to watch your kids.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Teen-Mom-2-Alum-Kailyn-Lowry-and-Elijah-Scotts-Relationship-Timeline.png><h3><strong>October 2023</strong></h3><p>Lowry officially confirmed she and Scott welcomed their first child together, son Rio, nearly a year prior.</p><p>“Elijah didn’t cry when I gave birth and that was really upsetting to me,” she revealed on an episode of her “Barely Famous” podcast, while speaking about her fifth child in depth for the first time. “I remember being upset … because Elijah is such a mellow, calm, cool and collected person. It takes a lot to bring him out of character. I’ve only seen him out of character one time.”</p><p>For Scott, that was because the couple “didn’t have time with him” until he had to be whisked away to the NICU right after his birth, Lowry explained. Furthermore, Scott had to be there for his partner, who was devastated by the news. He couldn’t “process my son being born because you were so upset,” Lowry recalled of his mindset.</p><p>“To me, [a NICU stay] is near death,” she shared. “It was traumatizing for me, but for him. It was, like, he [just] went to the NICU [and] came out so fast.”</p><p>Lowry revealed on “Barely Famous” weeks later that she is <a href=#>expecting babies No. 6 and 7</a> with Scott, calling her kids a “permanent souvenir” after getting pregnant while on vacation in Thailand with Scott.</p><h3>November 2023</h3><p>Lowry — <a href=#>then pregnant with twin boys</a> — opened up about her plans for her future with Scott. “He’s been pushing for [engagement],” she told People. “But I’ve already kind of done marriage once and I f–ked it up royally. So I’m a little hesitant.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lowry explained that she and Scott had already “jumped right into parenthood together,” so she didn’t want to rush into other relationship milestones. “I kind of would like to have something to look forward to in the future instead of doing everything all at once,” she said. “I think we have time. If we’re meant to be together, then we don’t need to rush into it tomorrow.”</p><p>She went on to gush that Scott is “a family man” and “different” from partners she’s had in the past. “He’s very, very much connected with his own family, with our family, and so he’s been a really good partner to me,” she said. “I feel like it’s a really good match.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zGZpZpmcqrput8Cio7KmXaG8uL7YZpinnF2auaq2wKFkrJufqcG0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
