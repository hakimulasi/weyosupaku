Unless we’re ready to commit to a major chop for life, we’re always going to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">need them</a>, but we’d rather not deal with them creasing our hair, snapping painfully or just looking kind of ugly on our wrist.</p><p>Scrunchies are an option — we certainly own and wear them — but they’re not going to be right for every occasion. First of all, they get in the way when we’re wearing long sleeves or layers like sweaters and hoodies. Secondly, they’re not going to look right with a lot of outfits, like nicer dresses with heels or even a pair of overalls. That’s why we’re all about <strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong>’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hair tie pick</a> right now!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">By Lilla Disc Elastic Hair Ties and Bracelets </a>for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!</strong></p><p>Guthrie once <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed to Us</a> what essentials she keeps in her bag, and it’s still a fantastic list to reference when filling up your own. “I love <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">By Lilla ponytail holders</a>,” the&nbsp;Today host said. “You can wear them as bracelets. 10 times a day I grab one off my wrist.” So maybe she keeps them more on her wrist than in her bag — but it only makes sense!</p><p>By Lilla is all about “rebelling against the black elastic.” That’s why the brand’s handmade hair ties instantly stand out, showcasing a row of golden discs across part of the band. A shiny, stunning accent that will actually make you love showing them off on your wrist! And there will be no more, “Oh my gosh, I accidentally left my hair tie on my wrist” during nicer occasions. You could even choose to wear it on purpose as a formal accessory. It will look great in your hair too, of course!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">By Lilla Disc Elastic Hair Ties and Bracelets </a>for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18</a> at Amazon!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">These elastic hair ties</a> also win out over others by preventing creasing, as well as being harder to lose. It’s not always easy to find a skinny black hair tie on the floor, but if you accidentally drop or misplace this one, those glimmering golden discs will help catch your eye!</p><p>Yet another reason to love these hair ties? They’re a perfect gift or <a href=# rel=noopener>stocking stuffer</a> for anyone. Even if their hair is short, they can still work as pretty, comfy accessories for their wrists!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">By Lilla Disc Elastic Hair Ties and Bracelets </a>for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20</a> at Amazon!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
