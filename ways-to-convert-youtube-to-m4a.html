The reason is simple, M4A videos tend to be smaller in size than MP3 files, making them the perfect solution when you do not have too much space on your device, and you need to download a lot of audio files.</p><p>In this article, we will share with you some easy methods about how to download YouTube videos to M4A format with desktop and online tools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Workable-Ways-to-Convert-YouTube-to-M4A-1024x569.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the M4A format?</h2><p>The M4A format is the successor of the MP3 format. Apple developed this format. In more detail, the MPEG-4 audio file format is an audio format that encodes its content with AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) codec or ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec). The former is for compressed audio and the latter for raw audio data. This is also known as M4A due to its file extension.</p><p>If you are questioning if M4A and MP4 are the same, they technically are not. Although both are MPEG-4, MP4 content is multimedia, whereas the M4A files are audio files only.</p><p>So, do not believe this format is unknown or something like that. Actually, M4A is very popular. iTunes uses it, and you can play it almost on any new device you can imagine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>M4A vs. MP3. What format is better?</h2><p>Since its beginning, the MP3 audio format has been the favored format for music diffusion and other completely auditory entertainment such as audiobooks. The MP3 reign happened thanks to its compression technology, which enabled to share of audio files of adequate quality in really small sizes compared to raw and uncompressed files. Although MP3 is still acceptable to today’s standards, technology progress in general, and better things appear. This is the case with the M4A format.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>M4A pros in contrast to MP3</h2><ul class=has-normal-font-size><li>An M4A file has better sound quality than MP3 files at the same bitrate.</li><li>This format enables encryption (this makes the file adopt the M4P file extension).</li><li>At a smaller size, M4A files have better quality than MP3 files. For example, at 128 kbps, M4A produces better sound than 192 kbps MP3.</li><li>M4A files allow the use of lossless compression.</li></ul><p>As you can see, M4A is the best format option for converting YouTube videos to audio files. It usually uses compressed audio, which means you will save storage space. And you will get better audio quality at a smaller size than MP3.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to convert videos from YouTube to M4A</h2><p>The most comfortable and safest method to convert a YouTube clip to M4A is to use a simple downloader.
