Her father is of Trinidadian descent, and her mother is of Irish descent. She has attended <i>Professional Performing Arts School for musical theater</i> for middle school. Further, she attended &nbsp;<i>Fiorello H.

The two were hired together in the fourth season of the show. It must have been fate that the two would meet and fall in love while working together in just one episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(10)-1580979450122.jpg><p>She shared the above picture in the Christmas of<i> 2018</i>, which has the caption "2013 -> 2018".

She uploaded a photo of them doing pottery together and wrote&nbsp;</p><p>"Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️<br>I love this goober so much it hurts"</p><p>This showed the love they have for each other. But tragedy struck when the couple seemingly broke up. The couple hasn't uploaded any pictures of each other for over a year, and Logan unfollowed Dylan on Instagram. &nbsp;</p><p>The break up seems to be on good terms because she hasn't deleted any pictures of them together. The couple were together for so long and were so into each other it's sad to see them apart.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The <i>23</i>-year-old actress from Boston has an estimated net worth of <strong>$525,000</strong>, which she earns from her acting career.
