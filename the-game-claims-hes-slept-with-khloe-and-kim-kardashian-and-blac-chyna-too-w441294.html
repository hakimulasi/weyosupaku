The rapper dished during an appearance on <i>The Wendy Williams Show</i> on Tuesday, September 20, which Kardashian sisters he’s allegedly slept with.</p><p>ICYMI, The Game made headlines last month after his track with DJ Khaled, “Sauce,” dropped on August 13. In the NSFW song, the artist raps that he “f–ked three Kardashians.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Williams presented the rapper with a photo of <b>Kris Jenner</b> and her five famous daughters — <b>Kourtney</b>, <b>Kim</b>, and <b>Khloé Kardashian</b>, and <b>Kendall </b>and <b>Kylie Jenner</b> — to find out which of them he claims to have seduced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-the-game-zoom-041af592-b89a-4c2d-91b6-aae913aac4a8.jpg><p>The talk show host first brought up Khloé. “Ah, sometimes it gets late at night … ” the rapper responded, trying to dodge the question.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-the-game-zoom-48051a23-2854-4f45-80df-7d4d8ce9ddc1.jpg><p>“You got down with Khloé. Now, did you get down with Kourtney?” Williams continued.</p><span class=caption></span><p>The Game said “no” to Kourtney, and when Williams moved on to Kim, he replied: “You know what, this is what I’ll say. I’ll tell you this. Kanye is a really good friend of mine. And they got really, really beautiful kids, and I don’t want to disrespect their family.”</p><p>Williams then jokingly asked The Game if he had sex with momager Kris or Kendall and Kylie before the rapper finally confessed that the third woman was <b>Rob Kardashian</b>’s fiancée — and Kardashian-to-be — <b>Blac Chyna</b>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It gets a little tricky. Chyna ain’t married yet,” he told the talk show host. “It’s all good, you know what I’m saying? It’s facts.”</p><p>As previously reported by <i>Us,</i> the other two are seemingly Kim and possibly Khloé.</p><p>The <i>Strong Looks Better Naked</i> author was linked to the rapper following her split from ex-husband <b>Lamar Odom</b>, but The Game denied they were ever romantically involved. Kim briefly dated the rapper years ago prior to marrying husband <b>Kanye West</b>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVitKK5xGaapZmZosButMSsZKyklaXBbsPIrZ9mo5ihvKZ5wKebZqOZonqsrdGdmKygmZa7bq3NnWSbpJGYeqS02KeYZqyfpHq4gJNqaXJsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
