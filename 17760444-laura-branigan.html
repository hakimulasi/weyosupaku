So they offered it to Laura. I have no idea if this is true, that's just the story.</p><p>There were two or three other songs during this period that I've heard were first offered to Donna but she turned them down, and they became big hits for other artists. I think Call Me (Blondie) was one of them.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 16</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 4:00 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I think "I Found Someone" is one of Cher's best songs, but only found out recently that Laura sang it first.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 18</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 4:11 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>R16 Based on the info about Gloria on Wikipedia (I know, not the most respected source) I'm not sure about that.</p><p>But I can "hear" Donna in both songs, totally.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 19</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 4:15 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Too bad Donna never covered Gloria, she would've sang the shit out of that song.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 20</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 4:58 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I heard her perform it live, at the MTC.

She would've easily given Donna a run as the disco queen, she was perfect. Loud, great voice, excellent projection and could sing plus Diane Warren and Michael Bolton to write for her.</p><p>Wasn't her husband some rich guy that backed her till she got a hit?</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 23</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 9:44 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I wonder how many of you I've crossed paths with.

Can't figure out why it wasn't a hit.</p><p>I remember seeing her on "The Tonight Show" during her heyday; I was expecting a raucous extrovert, but she was very shy and timid. Johnny Carson seemed charmed by her.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 34</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 4:04 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Laura was in the last bridge over from the 70s, (though she didn't have a hit) which saw the end of singers like ONJ, Diana Ross, Dolly Parton, Juice Newton, Anne Murray, the Pointer Sisters draw to a close for newer singers like Madonna, Whitney, Janet Jackson to take over. Even oldies like the Carpenters and Lulu managed to pull off top 20 hits in the early 80s. Only Sheena Easton managed to span the entire 80s of female singers and then she was gone by the early 90s.</p><p>Laura's big early hits were reworks by Diane Warren and others of European songs, which they wrote English lyrics too, like Ti Amo and Solitare.</p><p>Laura also had a #11 hit with How Am I Supposed to Live Without You, which writer Michael Bolton took to #1 for himself later on as well as had a top 40 hit with "The Power of Love" which Celine took to #1 in the 90s. So she picked some good songs.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 35</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 7:36 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>[quote]Only Sheena Easton managed to span the entire 80s of female singers and then she was gone by the early 90s.</p><p>Excuse me, bitch?</p><p>"Take Me Home" - 1979</p><p>"Dead Ringer for Love" - 1981</p><p>"I Found Someone" - 1987</p><p>"We All Sleep Alone" - 1988</p><p>"After All" - 1989</p><p>"If I Could Turn Back Time" - 1989</p><p>"Just Like Jesse James" - 1989</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 36</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 19, 2016 7:46 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>The American lyrics of Gloria were about a fucked-out old whore and that, along with Laura's voice, made me think she was in her 40s.
