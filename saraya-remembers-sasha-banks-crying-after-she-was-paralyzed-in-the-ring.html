That is what happened to Saraya as she had to retire early after&nbsp;getting kicked from the back by Sasha Banks during a 2017 WWE MSG Show.</p><p>The six-woman tag team match was called off after Saraya was unable to move and was paralyzed for some time in the ring. Afterwards, Saraya kept herself busy in WWE with a variety of roles until her exit earlier this year.</p><p>While speaking to Chris Jericho on his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Talk is Jericho</a>&nbsp;podcast, Saraya revealed that after she took the bump, she noticed that Sasha Banks, Bayley, Mickie James, Mandy Rose, and Sonya Deville were crying.</p><p>“My neck just friggin snapped back like I was in a car crash. And then I was like paralyzed for like a couple of minutes, which is the most terrifying thing. I just remember laying there, and then I didn’t cry, but I knew instantly I was just like, ‘This is it like I’m done? Like, I’m toast, right?’ I look over and I see Sasha [Banks], Bayley and there’s Mickie James and everyone. They were just crying. I look at Mandy and Sonya, and they were crying.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see how Saraya will be booked in the coming weeks. For the time being, she is just happy to be back on television. Fans should see what the company has in store for her next week.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on Saraya in AEW?
