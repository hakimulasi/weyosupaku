Lovato also called them “<a href=#>diet culture vultures</a>.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Bigg Chill</a> reacted to the accusations, explaining that they have items for all types of dietary restrictions, including diabetes, celiac disease and vegans, in addition to fully indulgent treats. They noted, “We are sorry you found this offensive,” after detailing how they work.</p><p>Lovato, in turn, criticized the overall experience in the store, calling it <a href=#>“triggering and awful”</a> before giving suggestions of how to better explain the diabetic and vegan specific foods and labeling choices.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Leah McSweeney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jameela Jamil</strong></a> later weighed in on the controversy, with the <a href=#>Real Housewives of New York City</a> star, 38, calling Lovato out for <a href=#>their “disgusting” comments</a> that could have lost a small business its customers.</p><p>Jamil, 35, on the other hand, defended Lovato via her Instagram Story, noting how sad it was to see how people came after the musician following her comments.</p><p>“What I was mostly curious about is watching people rush to deliberately misunderstand her intention and stance, and frame her as ignorant and careless, and inherently bad. <a href=#>Pile on of mockery of the people who are constantly trying to help</a> … are problematic in ways we don’t consider. You’re not just discouraging the person in question for making themselves vulnerable in order to help others, you’re discouraging future people from doing the same,” she wrote.</p><p>The Misery Index host added: “It’s just mockery and cruelty and maligning of a woman’s character who is navigating unchartered territory of being super famous, super young, super outspoken, super honest and vulnerable and super fragile and strong at the same time.</p><p>Lovato reposted Jamil’s posts, writing, “Thank you queen. Literally so grateful you get me and that I can call you a close friend. I love you.”</p><p>The “Sorry Not Sorry” singer <a href=#>apologized for her controversial stance</a> on Monday, April 19, in an eight-minute Instagram video.</p><p>“I want to make L.A. and this whole country a safer — and this whole f–king world — a safer environment,” Lovato said. “People with eating disorders should be able to go in and feel safe wherever they want to eat. <a href=#>Everything I’m doing is well-intentioned</a>, you have to understand.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>They concluded: “It’s really important that everyone hears that my intentions were not to come in and bully a small business … I walked in and was so triggered that I left without froyo and it made me really sad. And that’s all it was.”</p><p>Scroll through for everything we know about the drama:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2SxprnIZqOorpGpvLR52KierqqkYrCwutOrpq%2BdoqjGbsPHmqtmrJ9iuK%2B71mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
