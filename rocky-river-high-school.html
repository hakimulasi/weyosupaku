Counselors will be highly visible throughout the building and available to assist with grief counseling.</p><p>If your family has experienced a death or similar loss recently, this accident may bring up strong feelings. While this may be a normal experience, we want to provide assistance if needed. Please inform your student’s teacher or our counselors if there is any additional information the school should know so we can support your student’s needs.</p><p>This difficult time can be stressful and confusing. A sudden death may be disturbing to you as well as to your student. For this reason, we especially want you to know of our care and support. Thank you for your continued support of&nbsp;Rocky River High School.”</p><p>No further details have been released on social media, and students’ identities have remained unknown.
