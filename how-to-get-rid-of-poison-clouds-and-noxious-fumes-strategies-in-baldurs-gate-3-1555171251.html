You can ignite the fumes temporarily using fire spells or a lit torch to dissipate them. Additionally, should you encounter a vent emitting noxious fumes, placing a sizeable object, like clothing or a crate, over it can effectively block the release of fumes. Being attentive to these tactics will help you navigate these hazards successfully.</span></p><h2><span>How to Get Rid of Poison Clouds and Noxious Fumes?</span></h2><p><span>Dealing with these hazardous elements in Baldur's Gate 3 requires specific approaches:</span></p><h4><span>Clearing Noxious Fumes</span></h4><p><span>Noxious fumes are dangerous due to their damage over time effect.
