The True Blood star, 31, came out as bisexual in 2010 and is crusading against the crude stereotypes about those who identify as bisexualâ€”or gay, lesbian, transgender, or otherwise. &nbsp;</p><p>Paquin <a href=#>stopped by HuffPost Live</a> last week and spoke about her own sexuality and her relationship to husband <strong><a href=#>Stephen Moyer</a></strong>. In recognition of LGBT Pride Month, she tweeted in June, "Proud to be a happily married bisexual mother. Marriage is about love not gender."</p><p>"There's people that are going to probably go to their grave thinking whatever they think about the LGBT community," she said in the interview with HuffPost Live. "That's their problem, not mine. And there's people that think that monogamy and bisexuality are mutually exclusive. Again, their problem not mine."</p><p>The X-Men star has been married to Moyer, 44, since August 2010. They got engaged in August 2009 after meeting on the set of the HBO series True Blood.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"The reason I feel like it's important to talk about this stuff is that the more normal and, frankly, mundane and boring this stuff becomes, I think the better it's going to be for everyone who is part of our community," Paquin added.&nbsp;</p><p>Paquin and Moyer are the parents to a set of twins, who were born in September 2012. "They're nuts," <a href=#>Moyer said in September 2013</a> about son Charlie and daughter Poppy. "I think Anna's very excited about them walking and I'm like, 'Just wait.' Our lives are over once that happens!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6WerGt0K6gp2WSnsCmxNSao6KsqWKur7CMpqanp5eWurp5wKucp6xdosK1wcClo7Jlla2wrcHSoq2eZWJlfnV%2BkHBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
