We had rum punch and spoke for hours.”</p><p id=eDAq6FndI7U data-wc=61>They kept their blossoming relationship under wraps for the first week of the tour, although Molly confided in her Strictly pal Fleur East and Tyler told pro dancer Kai Widdrington, whose response was: ‘We knew!’. &nbsp;“For a week we were sneaking around, but the whole group knew we liked each other anyway, so we thought: ‘What are we doing?’” laughs Molly.</p><p id=eC7PN8LBtkP data-wc=36>“The minute I’d leave Molly, I'd miss her,” says Tyler, who pinpoints the Newcastle date in early February as the moment they knew it was love. “When you both feel it, you just know,” agrees Molly.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
