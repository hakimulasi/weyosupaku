Head for the upper right area of the map when you are at Koboh and reach Fort Kah’lin. Then players need to find a tower high enough to grapple with it and get inside the fort. However, caution is needed as the area is swarming with B1 droids. If you want to, you can fight them by practicing some lightsaber moves or trying out your Force abilities. Once you clear out the area, you will come across a circular opening in the ground where Oggdo is being kept.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-defeat-the-frog-like-creature><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_to_defeat_the_frog-like_creature></span><strong>How to defeat the frog-like creature?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-06-164912-1024x703.jpg><p>Source Star Wars Jedi Survivor</p><p>Hop in through the opening and get ready to battle for your lives, as Oggdo will prove to be a tough opponent. First and foremost, you will have to rely on close-range combat, so get ready for some fierce <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Light Saber action</a>. Moreover, you need to be on the move all the time. Do not underestimate Oggdo’s size and build; it is quite agile. Keep hitting Oggdo until its health bar depletes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>As the battle rages on, Oggdo will change its tactics and jump from side to side to make things even harder. Additionally, it will use its frog-like tongue and try to attack you from a distance. Whenever Oggdo glows red, it means he’s going to hit you with an unblockable attack. You need to stay clear of it, as it will do great damage. Furthermore, Oggdo will glow when it tries to accomplish a powerful attack, so evade it at all costs.</p><p>The tongue grab is the last red attack. To avoid this deadly attack, you have to go as far as possible from the boss. Between these attacks, he will bite repeatedly. This is a great opportunity to attack him. Time your attacks and evasive maneuvers precisely. Once the health bar hits zero, you will defeat it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-06-164747-1024x715.jpg><p>Players should keep in mind that it will take a great amount of health regeneration stim to fight a great foe like Oggdo. So it’s better to fight the creature quite late in the game when you have enough stims (10). You can choose whether you want to battle the droids surrounding the circular opening or not, but it’s better to get rid of the pesky troublemakers early.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHq0wMCrZLCZoqh6q7HDomSsraKrtre70WaroZ1dqL2iw81mpp9ln5y0pbuMoaawZaSkeqe1zZ1kmqaUYrGmssSaq2asmJp6pL7EmquuqpVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
