One of my beauty resolutions this year was to start <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>exfoliating more regularly</a>, whether it be on my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>lips</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>body</a>, or face. I’ve tried a few chemical exfoliants in the past that delivered OK results, but I’m pretty pleased with my most recent find, a non-irritating formula that works with just one application. Did I mention it’s only $6?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Good Molecules Overnight Exfoliating Treatment</a> has AHAs and BHAs like lactic acid, glycolic acid, and salicylic acid to help make your skin look brighter and less irritated. The glycolic and lactic acids help smooth your skin while the salicylic acid can help with breakouts. The combo is a powerful one-two punch for transforming your skin while you sleep. It’s gentle enough for sensitive skin and the formula is cruelty-free, fragrance-free, and vegan, to boot.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lately, I’ve had flaky skin and breakouts around my mouth and chin, so everything the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Good Molecules Overnight Exfoliating Treatment</a> promised sounded pretty good to me. I have reactive skin, so finding a gentle enough chemical exfoliant has been a challenge. I heeded the instructions on the bottle and used a very small amount my first night. I let it sit on my skin for a few minutes before adding my moisturizer. It very briefly tingled, but it wasn’t at all unpleasant.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I woke up, I was shocked to see that my chin area felt a lot smoother than it had just the night before. While my zits weren’t gone, they had definitely diminished in size and redness. The results were so good and instant that I had to fight the impulse to put more on the next morning. (The treatment can be used during the day, but be sure to put SPF on afterwards.) The brand recommends using it two to three times a week to work up a tolerance to the ingredients. This product was so impressive that I was positively giddy to put it on two nights later.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amazon reviewers had similar experiences to mine. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One person</a> who identified as having oily skin said it “helped improve the texture and appearance” of their skin and that they don’t find themselves with “as many breakouts or needing to physically scrub” their face. A <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">second reviewer</a> said they had “dry sensitive skin” and that this is “least irritating while being the most effective exfoliant.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It sounds like it’s almost too good to be true, but <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Good Molecules’ Overnight Exfoliating Treatment</a> can help smooth skin and diminish blemishes quickly and effectively without breaking the bank.
