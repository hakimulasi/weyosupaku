The pictures — featured alongside a story called “Lea the Brave” — show the Glee star posing provocatively in a series of revealing outfits and lingerie. <a href=#>See more pics of Lea’s hot body here</a>.</p><p>In one shot, the 27-year-old “Cannonball” singer flaunts her slim figure in a skimpy blue Vionnet bodysuit, which she pulls down around her hip to reveal a small tattoo of a bird. In another, she stands with her arms akimbo, rocking a simple black DKNY bodysuit and Christian Louboutin heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“My friends call me Grandma, but, like, Grandma’s killing it right now. I’m pretty sure Grandma nailed it in a half-naked Terry Richardson shoot, okay?” Michele says in the accompanying interview with Mary H.K. Choi. “So I’m fine with it. I just do my thing. I do what’s best for me. That’s it.”</p><p>Her “thing,” she explains, is being a bit of a homebody. “I don’t like things that other people like,” she shares. “I don’t like clubs or crazy, loud music. I don’t drink a lot, and maybe that makes me boring, but I’d rather be in bed watching Homeland with my cat, Sheila, eating a sandwich.”</p><p>Nights like that have helped Michele cope with the loss of her boyfriend and costar <a href=#><strong>Cory Monteith</strong></a>, who died at age 31 last July of heroin and alcohol toxicity. But she has also found solace in stars like <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a> and <strong>Stevie Nicks</strong>, whom she counts among her friends.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There were people who were like, ‘I am not f—ing leaving your side, and that, for me, was Stevie,” the Broadway vet says of the Fleetwood Mac singer. “She’s like a fairy. She’s given me so many gifts along the way, and when I say gifts, I mean tools and advice and support.”</p><p>“She told me from the beginning that music is going to be [my] therapy, and at the time, I was like, ‘What the f–k are you talking about, Stevie Nicks? I don’t want to listen to music. I can’t do anything,'” Michele, whose debut album, Louder, drops March 4, recalls. “But once you get out a little bit of the tunnel, when you slowly start to feel like you can be yourself a little bit, it does help. It’s so cool I have her number.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZFiuqqvx56jnmWYlrmnec2aop6cXamys77YZqmim5iWv6W%2FzqdkqaCfqbxuv8eopq1lpJa5rL%2BMnKarsV2ivK%2FAxKKroatdmbKiwMdmaWlpZGeBc3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
