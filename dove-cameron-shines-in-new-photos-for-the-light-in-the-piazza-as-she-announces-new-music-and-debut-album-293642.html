That is about to change as Dove has signed with Disruptor Records and is working on getting her first album to the public. Sharing an update on her official Instagram account, Dove said she is excited to release her new music within the next few weeks.</p><p>At 23-years-old, Dove is slowly making the jump from Disney star to young adult. It‚Äôs sometimes a treacherous path for celebrities who launched their careers with Disney but for Dove, the relationship continues to thrive. She is known for playing the role of Mal in Disney‚Äôs Descendants and will reprise the part on August 2, 2019, when Descendants 3 premiers on the Disney channel network. Dove won a Primetime Emmy for her portrayal of twins Liv and Maddie in the popular eponymous children‚Äôs series.</p><p>Dove hasn‚Äôt had any scandals and has excelled in the world of musicals. She played the role of Amber Von Tussle in the 2016 NBC production of Hairspray Live!</p><p>She is currently on stage in London playing the role of Clara in the musical The Light in the Piazza, opposite opera sensation Renee Fleming.</p><p>Dove shared a picture on her Instagram account from The Light in the Piazza where she and Renee are both on stage. She provided the following caption.</p><p>‚ÄúPure joy üåπ living my dream in this show next to this legend every day @litpmusical.‚Äù</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/By0GYoRnswM/</p><p>You may see a clip of Dove Cameron and Rob Houchen singing ‚ÄúSay it Somehow‚Äù for The Light in the Piazza below. There will only be twenty shows in London that kicked off on June 14, 2019.</p><p>Dove has expressed her joy at being cast in the musical and has described the performance and this period in her career as the best in her life.</p><p></p><p>While many fans have heard Dove singing classically styled-soprano songs, she also sings pop music. It‚Äôs unclear what style of music her new album will be, but with a new music release in several weeks and Descendants 3 coming in August, it looks as if the public will hear more from Dove over the summer.</p><p>In a viral photo that Dove shared with her 25.4 million followers, she was seen lying down, staring at the camera suggestively saying she was waiting for her music.</p><p>Dove captioned the viral photo with the following.</p><p>‚ÄúMe waiting patiently to release all this new music in a few weeks.‚Äù</p><p>You may see that photo below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/By2WH8MHUkG/</p><p>In addition to Dove‚Äôs musical theater performances and the upcoming premiere of Descendants 3, Dove completed filming The Angry Birds Movie 2 that will premiere in theaters on August 14, 2019.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Dove has a busy summer ahead of her with her movie and the return of Descendants 3 coming out.
