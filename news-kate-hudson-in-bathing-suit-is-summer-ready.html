(She had in one hand her own King St. Vodka.) The How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days star is trying to make time for herself and this over-scheduled world. She loves spending time with her family and at home, or working hard on her active line, Fabletics, but in between all that it's so important to her to make time for her health and wellness, passing those healthy habits onto her children. How does she stay so fit? </span><span>Read on to see how Kate Hudson stays in shape and the photos that prove they workâ€”and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>In her book </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Pretty Happy: Healthy Ways to Love Your Body</a><span>, Kate promotes the importance of well-being. She understands life can get busy, especially seeing how her mother, <span class=yKMVIe aria-level=1>Goldie Hawn</span>, handled raising her, but it's still so important to put your mental and physical health first. "I'm finally at a place in my life where if someone wants to know what I do to stay healthy, why not tell them?" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she asks</span></a><span>. "Why not put it out there?" She's not gatekeeping her tricks and wants to promote a healthy lifestyle to other busy women&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/kate-hudson-1004.jpg><p><span>"Dancing is the thing for me," she says. "It just makes me feel so much better." We got a little taste of her dancing skills on the show Glee when she guest starred as Cassandra, Rachel Berry's dance teacher in college. She loves to take classes in a more structured environment and sometimes just freestyle, being goofy on her own. Blasting music in the comfort of her own house. "Sometimes I'll lock myself in a room and dance. I'll turn music on as loud as possible and just get weird!" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says, laughing</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/kate-hudson-1003.jpg><p><span>She is constantly changing a lot in her life, and that includes her workouts. "Change is my constant," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I change my routine. I change my look. I change my mind," said Hudson. When it comes to her fitness routine, that's the thing she likes to switch up the most. "I'll do Tracy Anderson, I'll do Body by Simone, I do everything," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hudson said</span></a><span>. "Nothing, literally nothing, makes me feel like I'm back to my body more than pilates," she says. "I'll travel, and I'll go for a run or I'll spin, but when I go home and get on the reformer or the Cadillac, my body immediately goes back. I can see an instant shift."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/kate-hudson-1005.jpg><p><span>She really avoids fads and just does what works for her own individual body and what she enjoys doing. "I don't judge my practice, ever," she says. She loves challenging her mind and body with transcendental meditation and Kundalini. "You could sit there and not think of your mantra for your whole practice, but you're still benefiting," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. She's also a big believer in taking a day or two to yourself. "Throw that idea of 'I have to, I have to, I have to' out the window."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/kate-hudson-1002.jpg><p><span>Just like exercising, when it comes to Kate's eating, she tries not to obsess, but also to stay mindful. She aims to have five small meals each day, trying to pick mostly plant-based options. "I've pretty much cut meat out," she says. "I don't remember the last time I ate a steak." She sometimes has difficulty with her morning routine, not being much of a breakfast person but has heard that it's important to eat something in the morning. "The hardest thing for me is eating right when I get up, because I don't like to. I'm not one of those people who wakes up hungry," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she explains</span></a><span>. "I wake up and I want coffee and even a green juice, but everybody says you've got to eat something, even if it's little. So that's sort of the hardest, but I realize that when I do, I eat less during the day or late at night."&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpJmkmnqpwcOspqdlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKKqZqulorqmvoyrnJqcqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
