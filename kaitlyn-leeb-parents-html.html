As a result, she got to leave a&nbsp;remarkable impression in the industry with a plethora of notable projects such as Spinning Out, Degrassi: The Next Generation, Single Ladies, and&nbsp;Christmas with a Prince.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Kaitlyn Leeb Started as a Model</h2><p>Before Leeb dabbled into acting at the age of 15, she started with print modeling. However, her parents fully supported her career choice and introduced her to the acting industry.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Courtesy of her parents' undying support, the now-33-year-old could continue acting and modeling throughout high school and university.</p><p>She modeled for&nbsp;campaigns and billboards for companies such as FUZE fruit drinks, Dentyne Ice, and Virgin Mobile.&nbsp;Leeb even won a beauty pageant titled Miss Chin Bikini in 2009, the year she played Kaitlyn Wong in&nbsp;The Jazzman.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Kaitlyn Leebâ€™s Mom Is a Cancer Survivor</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Information about&nbsp;Leeb's parents isn't public knowledge,&nbsp;but it is known that her mother survived breast cancer in 2010. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Having seen the consequences of cancer in her family, the <a href=# rel=follow>Shadowhunters star</a> timely volunteered in programs to help cancer survivors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In April 2014, the stunning actress took part in a party that aimed to raise money for breast cancer research. She also&nbsp;modeled for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cover of a book</a> about the disease in May 2017.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kaitlyn Leeb on How Modeling Helped Her</h2><p>Leeb knows well that modeling and acting are two different things. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Talk Nerdy With Us</a> in October 2015, she gushed about her modeling stints and elaborated on how&nbsp;it differed from acting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In her own words, acting was more than posing for a camera. Of course, one had to be realistic enough to breathe life into a character. But modeling was possible with good poses and make-up.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Despite the differences, the&nbsp;Heartland actress remarked modeling&nbsp;taught her basic skills needed for filming. For example, she knew about posture, lighting, and camera angles.</p><p>To top it all off, she knew how to manage her image and present herself at auditions. Keeping the advantages in mind, Leeb shared she was glad she did modeling before acting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And rightfully so, the Toronto native's experience with cameras has helped her perform better. In&nbsp;addition, she has bagged over 30&nbsp;projects to date. Her latest movie, Romance in the Wilds, started streaming on VUDU on September 7, 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As for the foreseeable future, she will feature in movies such as Christmas in the Wilds, Christmas with a Prince: The Royal Baby, and&nbsp;Be Mine, Valentine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORnsGtxc1mo56dkmK9or7Ep6usZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
