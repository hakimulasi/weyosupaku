Shelby Stanga earned his net worth as the star of Ax Men, an American documentary reality television series which aired on the History Channel. Shelby Stanga moved to the swamps north of New Orleans when he was only nine years old. He has been a logger there for over 37 years. On the show he was often accompanied by his dog Wiley, his friends Earl and Bob and his cousin Jarvis. Shelby was part of the Swamp Man Logging Team on the third and fourth season of the Ax Men reality show. Stanga and his crew work the summer logging season on the show.</p><p>The Swamp Man Logging Team also appeared in season five of the television reality series. Some of the logs he recovers have been sitting in the mud for many many years. Some of these trees range in age from 2,000 years old to 5,000 years old, and have absorbed minerals from the mud in a process that alters the appearance of the wood. This process results in a rainbow of colors - yellow, red, blue, green, purple and brown - and a very attractive product that Stanga sells to such furniture-makers as the Northshore's Keith Dufour. Stanga starred in Ax Men from 2009 to 2016 and the series ran for nine seasons. He also starred in the reality TV series The Legend of Shelby the Swamp Man in 2013 and appeared in an episode of the series Man vs. Wild in 2008.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvSoZylmqliwLWtzaCYZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
