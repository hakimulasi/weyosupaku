That’s, like, way beyond my skill set,” the Ireland native, 35, said in a Sunday, October 2, Instagram Story video. “I’m there to do the acting and, you know, I don’t have a choice in most things. I wouldn’t be like, ‘This my best hair look.’”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I mean, <a href=#>I was meant to look like that</a> and <strong>Lou [Bannell]</strong> who did this hair and makeup, I love you. But, I was meant to look like a sad poodle, so I looked like a sad poodle.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Derry Girls</a>&nbsp;</i>alum has portrayed Penelope Featherington — a close friend of <a href=#><strong>Claudia Jessie</strong>’s Eloise Bridgerton</a> — on <a href=#>the first two seasons of&nbsp;<i>Bridgerton</i></a>, which first debuted on Netflix in December 2020. Penelope, who was eventually revealed to be the anonymous writer behind the “Lady Whistledown” news sheet, is <a href=#>set to lead season 3 opposite <strong>Luke Newton</strong></a> (Colin Bridgerton). The third season is currently in production.</p><p class=p1>“I know I can’t share anything about season 3, no pictures or anything yet, but we’re saving them and <a href=#>when you see what we’re doing, I’m so excited</a>,” Coughlan teased on Sunday.</p><p class=p1>As the&nbsp;<i>Harlots&nbsp;</i>actress swiftly clapped back over her character’s season 1 and 2 curls, she also <a href=#>defended Penelope’s actions in the period drama</a>.</p><p class=p1>“People get mad at me for, like, things Penelope did but<a href=#> I really didn’t do them</a> because <a href=#>it’s a script and I say the words</a> and do acting,” Coughlan admitted in her social media upload. “Please be nice to me!”</p><p class=p1>The “Whistle Through the Shamrocks”&nbsp;podcast creator has previously been candid about her red wig on the series <a href=#>after wearing it throughout the first two seasons</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I used to lovingly call this look ‘The Hair Willy,’” she jokingly captioned a June throwback<a href=#> Instagram</a> snap. “Suffice to say she’s ready for the S3 glow up.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bridgertons-Nicola-Coughlan-Defends-Penelopes-Sad-Poodle-Hairstyle-01.jpg><p class=p1>Coughlan has also been open about <a href=#>dealing with negative comments about her body</a> while working on some of Netflix’s most popular shows (<i>Bridgerton</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Derry Girls</i>).</p><p class=p1>“Hello! So just a thing — if you have an opinion about my body please, please don’t share it with me,” <a href=#>she tweeted in January</a>. “Most people are being nice and not trying to be offensive but I am just one real life human being and it’s really hard to take the weight of thousands of opinions on how you look — being sent directly to you every day.”</p><p class=p1>Coughlan continued at the time: “If you have an opinion about me that’s ok, I understand I’m on TV and that people will have things to think and say, but I beg you not to send it to me directly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2FqrDGnqmtp56oeq%2B1wqijmmWTpMKotMuapWaclZuyr7DSZqeeppWhvLGx0maqmpxdpbywsMueZKGZmad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
