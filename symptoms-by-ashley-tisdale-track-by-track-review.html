Her first album in 10 years has fans listening to it on repeat. In the past, Tisdale has opened up about her struggle with anxiety and depression and how this album reflects that.</p><p>Every title is a symptom she faced while dealing with her anxiety.</p><h3>We break down the 9 track album for you:</h3><h4>Symptoms</h4><p>The track has a catchy beat and is a great way to start off the album. It talks about having those feelings of anxiety when you first enter a new relationship and are just coming out of a bad one. You don’t know how to feel or act right away. It is so relatable.</p><h4>Looking Glass</h4><p>This song approaches the subject of someone not knowing the real her and needs a different perspective or “looking glass” to see through her. That person shouldn’t believe what they read or hear about her and needs to get to know her to know the real her. Isn’t that what everyone wants? To have the people close to them to know the real and true them?</p><h4>Love Me and Let Me Go</h4><p></p><p>The previously released single chronicles her struggle with trying to let her anxiety go. The clever songwriter that she is, makes people believe this is about a relationship, but to have a song this good be about anxiety proves she is an incredible songwriter.</p><h4>Insomnia</h4><p>In this track, Tisdale can’t sleep because she is so consumed with someone (assuming it’s her husband) and goes through the typical feelings someone has when they are missing the one they love.</p><h4>Vibrations</h4><p>This may be the catchiest tune on the album. It talks about staying home with the one you love and still having good vibes with them even though you are just sitting on your couch drinking wine. It doesn’t matter what you do with them, as long as you’re with them. So relatable!</p><h4>Under Pressure</h4><p>No, it’s not the Queen and David Bowie “Under Pressure” but still is a great song to listen to. You wake up in the morning and don’t feel your best because everything is stressing you out. You feel under pressure from others to get through it. You feel stress from everything but you have to live your life your own way.</p><h4>True Romance</h4><p>When you are in a real relationship, there will be ups and downs. It is not perfect, but it is ok because that person gets you. At the end of the day, you come home to that person even if they drive you mad, which most people go through in a relationship.</p><h4>Voices in My Head</h4><p></p><p>The first single Tisdale released off of the album really set the mood for the whole piece. VIMH is about her struggle with her anxiety and the voices that tell her that she is not good enough or she is doing something wrong. This song really helps others struggling with anxiety in any form. It lets others know that they are not alone and you can overcome it.</p><h4>Feeling So Good</h4><p>What a way to end the album. It basically sums up everything she was talking about. She has let go of the dark times and is now embracing it and feels great. She is in a great place in her life.</p><p>This album is a solid 5 stars. It will help a lot of people struggling with whatever they are going through. For fans of her music, who have waited this long, it was worth the wait.</p><p>She is back and doing better than ever. We hope she goes on tour soon!</p><h4>What is your favorite track on the new album “Symptoms” by Ashley Tisdale?
