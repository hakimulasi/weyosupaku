Less than a year after splitting from <strong>Jason Derulo</strong>, and just a few months into her relationship with <strong>Sage the Gemini</strong>, <strong>Jordin Sparks</strong> is already hearing wedding bells.</p><p>Speaking about her rapper beau in an interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> on Wednesday, July 15, the "Battlefield" singer, 25, hinted that things were getting serious.</p><p>"It's very early, but I'm not the type of person who stays in a relationship if I can't see it going further than a casual relationship," Sparks told ET. "I could see marriage, but we haven't really planned anything. He does call me his wife, though."</p><p>The American Idol alum and her new man (real name: Dominic Wynn Woods) first sparked romance rumors back in April, when she shared a photo of them gazing into each other's eyes on a snowy day. At the time, she had been single for about seven months following her breakup with Derulo.</p><p>Sparks and the "Talk Dirty" crooner dated for three years before going their separate ways in September 2014. Their split wasn't exactly amicable; she later dissed him in her song "How Bout Now (Remix)."</p><p>"There was a lot of pressures of marriage. There was a lot of arguing and stuff like that that just weighed on our relationship over time," Derulo told Ryan Seacrest in September. "When you stop having more good times than bad bad times, itâ€™s time to call it quits. It becomes something that is unhealthy."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Given Sage the Gemini's affectionate nickname for Sparks, it doesn't seem as if the marriage thing will be an issue this time around.</p><p>"I feel like it happens at different times for everybody," Sparks told ET of finding love with the rapper, 23. "Sometimes you might feel like you want something right now and it's not the right thing for you and sometimes you probably shouldn't stay in it, but I would say love finds you when you least expect it. I'm a firm believer in not looking for it. It will find you."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp6KZtq950qmYq6OjYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGLAorPEZquhnV2csq61zaJkmqSimq6lxYycmKWko2K1pr6MoaCsZaees6Z5kWlobmllbHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
