After leaving the Sharks and the audience stunned by a smashing a pumpkin with his head, the entrepreneur proceeded to point out how his innovative scraping glove would make the tedious and nasty job of cleaning the pumpkins' innards a breezy task. The Sharks Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daymond John</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin O'Leary</a>, and guest Shark Kendra Scott, were immediately impressed by the very innovative product.
