He went to see the geishas and he’s staying.”</p><p class=p1>Stanford — who previously<a href=#> moved to Japan to be the talent manager</a> for a young TikTok star following Garson’s death — sent Carrie a message and photo to explain what he was up to. “He’s a Shinto monk. … No bit, he had a big, ugly fight with his TikTok client. She fired him and ran off to Berlin, he wandered around Kyoto for days crying,” Carrie explained. “[He] eventually found his way into a temple where, I guess, he stopped crying and he wrote, ‘Carrie, for the first time in my life, I felt peace, real peace.’”</p><p class=p1>Anthony, who married Stanford in the <a href=#><i>Sex and the City 2</i></a> feature film, was taken aback by Carrie’s revelation. “Why didn’t he tell me this himself?” he asked, putting down<a href=#> the cosmopolitan drink</a> that Carrie had offered him in Stanford’s honor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Carrie-Tells-Anthony-That-Stanford-Found-Peace-Doesn-t-Plan-to-Return-to-New-York-City-281.jpg><p class=p1>Carrie explained, per the note, that Stanford was afraid to tell Anthony out of fear that he would mock his newfound bliss.</p><p class=p1>“He also wrote that, ‘My lawyers have enclosed all the legal work needed. The apartment and all of my belongings are now his,’” Carrie said to a now-surprised Anthony. “I want no attachments. I have let go of all things that no serve me and I let it all go with love.”</p><p class=p1>Anthony remarked that he was “stunned” that Stanford could let everything go as he’s been the complete opposite. “Good for him, good for him,” he tearfully said before Carrie proposed a toast to “Stanny.”</p><p class=p1>When asked who would get to “keep the photo” of Stanford, Carrie proclaimed that she was “very attached” to the image of Garson’s character donning a traditional Japanese robe.</p><p class=p1>Anthony and Stanford had separated <a href=#>during <i>And Just Like That </i>season 1</a> when Stanford moved to Asia. Anthony, for his part, has since tried to move on. Season 2 even introduced <a href=#>a new love interest</a> in Italian poet Giuseppe (<strong>Sebastiano Pigazzi</strong>), who proclaimed in Thursday’s episode that he was in love with the Hotfellas breadmaker.</p><p class=p1>Thursday’s episode comes nearly two years after Garson <a href=#>died at the age of 57 in September 2021</a>. Garson, who is survived by <a href=#>son Nathen</a>, had <a href=#>privately battled pancreatic cancer</a> prior to his passing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It was a real shock,” Cantone, 63, said during a December 2021 appearance on SiriusXM’s <i><a href=#>Gilbert Gottfried’s Amazing Colossal Show</a>.</i> “None of us knew, and it was just, it was terrible. It was very sad.&nbsp; … Every time we did a benefit together, or like we did a couple of readings on Zoom, during COVID we were zooming. We were always, like, texting each other talking s–t. But I miss him, he made me laugh so hard and he was a great TV husband. Oh God, he was loved.”</p><p class=p1>New episodes of<i> And Just Like That</i> drop Thursdays on Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinnF2fwrTAjKWgpJ1dqbWiwIyrnJyZoGKwor7Ropxmn5mrsrR5xKamraGfo66tedKepZ2nlpt6tbuMrKuappakv6V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
