They very nearly started a subgenre of rock that can best be described as "bands that sound like Creed." Two of Creed's albums hit <a href=#>No. 1</a>&nbsp;on the charts, and The Chatanoogan&nbsp;says that included over <a href=#>53 million</a> album sales. It can't be denied that Creed was huge.</p><p>When things started going badly for Creed, they went catastrophic. How many bands can put on a show so terrible that fans file a lawsuit? It happened to Creed, according to Rolling Stone. Four fans filed suit in 2003 claiming lead singer Scott Stapp was so wasted he couldn't sing even one song properly.</p><p>Creed also topped a Rolling Stone poll of the worst band of the '90s, and it&nbsp;was not close. When they tried to do a reunion tour in 2009, the sales were so bad that Birmingham lowered the ticket price to 75 cents. Oof.</p><p>Stapp assaulted his wife, Jaclyn Nesheiwat, in 2007 and was <a href=#>arrested</a>. This came after his fistfight with the band 311 â€” Stapp was proving proved himself to be a violent, angry man. In 2017, his wife detailed accusations about Stapp's excessive drug use and psychiatric issues, including how he had been held in a psychiatric facility, had threatened to murder his family, claimed the CIA was after him, and made threats against Barack Obama. He's since gotten help and seems to be on the mend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kWpqb21fna61scNmpK6rmZi2orrSZpyvnaKuvK%2BxjK6qnpxdoby3sY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
