As of this writing, Renate's murder has not been officially solved, and Hall spoke to "People" magazine about the tragedy in 2016, stating, "No one deserves what happened to my sister. For a long time I was hesitant about sharing our story. I didn't want to be another well-known person saying, 'Look what happened to me and my family.' But then I said, 'Screw that. I can save a life.'" Tamron attended Temple University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Broadcast Journalism in 1992, then she moved to Texas for her broadcasting career.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After working as a general assignment reporter at KBTX in Bryan, Texas, Hall took the same position at KTVT in Fort Worth in 1994.

The couple welcomed son Moses Mitchell Hall Greener in April 2019. In 2014, as part of the "Shine A Light" campaign, each "Today" anchor chose a cause to support that year.

Tamron dedicated her Investigation Discovery show, "Deadline: Crime," to her older sister, and she told "The Grio" in 2013, "My sister's case has led me to focus a lot of my attention on domestic violence. We don't know what happened in her case, what I do know is that she was found in a swimming pool in the back of her home, face down, and it was ruled a homicide. My journey to speak out on domestic violence was based on conversations that I had with my sister." In 2014, Hall was honored with Safe Horizon's Voice of Empowerment award, and the organization collaborated with her on The Tamron ‚ù§ Renate Fund, which helps victims of domestic violence "find support as well as a place for friends and family to find resources."
