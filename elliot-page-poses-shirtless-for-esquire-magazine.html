I wasn’t OK, and I didn’t know how to talk about that with anyone,” Page said, adding that the studio told him to wear a dress to the movie’s Toronto Film Festival premiere.</p><p>“I said I wanted to wear a suit, and Fox Searchlight was basically like, ‘No, you need to wear a dress.’ And they took me in a big rush to one of those fancy stores on Bloor Street [in Toronto]. They had me wear a dress, and … that was that. And then all the <i>Juno</i> press, all the photo shoots – Michael Cera was in slacks and sneakers.”</p><p>The actor called the incident “really extremely, extremely f***ed up”.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if I’m trans or cis. Lots of cis women dress how I dress. That has nothing to f***ing do with it,” Page wrote.</p><p>“I get that people don’t understand. Oh, f**k you, you’re famous, and you have money, and you had to wear a dress, boo-hoo. I don’t not understand that reaction. But that’s mixed with: I wish people would understand that that sh*t literally did almost kill me.”</p><p>In a 2021 interview for <i><a class=body-link href=# title=time.com>Time</a></i> – Page’s first since disclosing he was trans – the actor said he “never recognised” himself on the red carpet previously.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“Even though [I was] an actor, just putting on a T-shirt cut for a woman would make me so unwell,” he said, adding that feminine clothing felt like a “costume”.</p><p>Since then, Page has made his Met Gala debut in a sharp Balenciaga suit and hit the 2022 Oscars in a Gucci tux, the latter of which he described as a moment of “trans joy”.</p><p><i>This story originally appeared on <a class=body-link href=#>Page Six</a> and is republished here with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ian6S4tHnMmp6aspmjsrR7zJqemrKZo7K0e8Slo6KnpGK9orPEZqeoq5WoerS0yKurpZ2jqHqnu9FmnKyppZ6%2FpnnMmp6aspmjsnC6xLCqZqukpL%2B6e49tnJpqlpawc62XcZ1xaJRsg6SxkHJqcHFpl32mssNw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
