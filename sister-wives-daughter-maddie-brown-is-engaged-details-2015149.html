She also shared some details about what to expect from her upcoming nuptials. “I showed Caleb the song I have wanted to walk down the [aisle] to since I was 15,” she wrote. “He got a little emotional when hearing it. So sweet!!”</p><p>The star added that she will continue her education before marriage. “There have been a lot of questions on me finishing school. YES,” she tweeted on Monday. “I will go all the way through till I finish with my Law degree.” Maddie has oftentimes gushed about her future husband via social media. In July, she wrote on Instagram: “Thank you for making me laugh everyday and teaching me about the difference between a 30-06 and a 7mag. I kinda dig you.”</p><p>TLC also <a href=#>shared additional details</a> from Maddie’s engagement, and photos of her ring.</p><p>“Love is in the air for Sister Wives‘ daughter Maddie who is newly engaged to fiance Caleb Brush!” the network confirmed in its post. “And, despite growing up in a polygamist family, Maddie and Caleb are opting to have a monogynous marriage.”</p><p>According to the network, Brush asked Brown family patriarch, <strong>Kody Brown</strong>, for permission to wed his daughter. “With Kody’s blessing, Caleb surprised Maddie with a blue diamond ring at a scenic look-out point,” TLC revealed. “The happy couple look forward to planning an outdoor country wedding with family and friends.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=350 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Maddie Brown and Caleb Brush Ring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Maddie is the daughter of <strong>Janelle Brown</strong>, one of Kody’s four wives including <strong>Meri, </strong><strong><a href=#>pregnant </a></strong><strong><a href=#>Robyn</a>, </strong>and <strong>Christine Brown</strong>. While the Brown family patriarch and wives are best known for their polygamist lifestyle, Maddie said on Sunday that she wanted a monogamous marriage.</p><p>“We are not living plural marriage,” Brush told <a href=#>People</a>, which first broke the story. “We support Maddie’s family with their choice of living plural marriage and they support us with our choice in just marrying each other.”</p><p>Her family also reacted to the news. “Congratulations @MaddieR_Brown I love you!…. and Caleb too!” her dad, Kody, tweeted after the announcement was made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The newly engaged reality star’s biological mother, Janelle, celebrated by retweeting Maddie’s announcement, while the other wives chimed in on the family news. “Congratulations @MaddieR_Brown!” Robyn wrote, while Christine elaborated: “Seriously?! They’re perfect together. Congratulations @MaddieR_Brown and Caleb.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The last wife, Meri, also tweeted congratulations to her adopted daughter. So happy we finally get to announce this!” she tweeted. “Congratulations @MaddieR_Brown and Caleb!!”</p><p>Meri famously made headlines this past February after it was revealed that she and Kody Brown had <a href=#>secretly divorced</a> in fall 2014. “We have chosen to legally restructure our family,” the Browns <a href=#>later told <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> in a statement. “We made this decision together as a family. We are grateful to our family, friends and fans for all their love and support.”</p><p>On Sister Wives‘ shocking Season 5 finale, it was shared that Meri, 45, was the one to first file for divorce. Several months after their split was finalized, the family patriarch legally married his youngest spouse Robyn, 37. The choice was made so that Kody could assume legal guardianship of Robyn’s three children from a previous relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWUlsKotNOeqWalkZmxqrGMm6mor55itrR5xKeemp%2BVmXqlsdOaoKWrXWd9coGQbXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
