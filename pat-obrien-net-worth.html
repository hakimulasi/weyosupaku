Pat later said that he had no recollection of leaving the voicemails (which included the phrase "let's get some hookers and cocaine"), telling <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> in 2014, "One of the byproducts of alcoholism are blackouts. I&nbsp; don't remember it."</p><p>O'Brien returned to rehab in early 2008, and in a 2014 interview with "People" magazine, he stated, "I jumped headfirst into recovery, clinging for dear life to the Hazelden program. Sean agreed to fly to this little country town for Thanksgiving. He made me promise to 'just quit lying.' His visit showed me what a treasure he was, and from that moment on, my mind free of alcohol and chemicals, I pledged to never let him down again."</p><p>While Pat was in rehab, <a href=# title="Donny Osmond Net Worth">Donny Osmond</a> filled in for him on "The Insider," and in March 2008, it was reported that O'Brien would no longer appear on the show.
