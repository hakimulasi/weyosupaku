Read on to learn 25 things about the actress.</p><p>1. My daughter [Lola, 15] and I are allergic to cats and dogs. I’ve compromised and we’re probably getting a fish.</p><p>2. My first jobs were babysitting and tutoring.</p><p>3. I just don’t have enough time to watch a lot of television. So, I stick with Sense8. I can’t wait for the next season.</p><p>4. When I’m naked, it’s awesome. But sometimes it gets really sweaty and I realize the materials on couches are just not that conducive to a bare bottom.</p><p>5. I love to dance in the dark at night by myself.</p><p>6. I love scuba diving and learning about our oceans.</p><p>7. If I hadn’t been an actress, I was thinking about being a marine biologist.</p><p>8. I have an upside-down beauty mark of a heart on my side belly area.</p><p>9. I’m obsessed with The Shade Room [on Instagram]. I went down the rabbit hole!</p><p>10 My favorite song is any song my mom [Isabel Celeste] has written. She wrote one for me.</p><p>11. My go-to karaoke song is Deee-Lite’s “Groove Is in the Heart.”</p><p>12. To relax on a day off, I meditate!</p><p>13. I was starstruck when I met <strong>Boy George</strong>. We took photos. This was pre-really good cell phones.</p><p>14. My favorite book is The Four Agreements [by <strong>Don Miguel Ruiz</strong>]. That’s always a good one to go back to.</p><p>15. I’m allergic to crustaceans as of, like, seven years ago. I regularly remind myself: “Remember that paella you didn’t eat when you were ‘vegan’ in Spain at 25? Yeah, that was a dumb move.”</p><p>16. I’m still in a group text with <strong>Tracie Thoms</strong> and <strong>Zoë Bell</strong> who I did [2007’s] Death Proof and [2013’s] Raze with.</p><p>17. I love <a href=#><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong></a>. She is just amazing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Rosario-Dawson.jpg><p>18. My worst personality trait is not asking for help.</p><p>19. I’m a superstrong person, but I’m also really sensitive.</p><p>20. “The journey is the destination” by Dan Eldon is my favorite quote. He was a young photojournalist stoned to death in Somalia [in 1993].</p><p>21. My favorite cocktail is a dirty martini just ’cause I really love olives.</p><p>22. I haven’t worked out for several years. I’m starting to feel it. [Lola] will challenge me to do splits. Then I’ll get up and I’m like, “I’m not gonna do that again.”</p><p>23. In high school, I was a straight-A student, but I was also someone who rolled out of bed last minute.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I need good makeup wipes because I’ll rub my eye in the middle of the night and wake up with a black eye!</p><p>25. I’m really loving the call-out culture and I look forward to seeing more people use their platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp6OWv6q7jJ2YsKufo3pzgYytn6Kml6h6urvUZpuopqRiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqusY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
