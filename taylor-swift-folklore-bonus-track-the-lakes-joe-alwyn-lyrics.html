When the physical edition of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s new album, <a href=#>Folklore</a>, came out on Friday, August 7, fans got one extra song that was not included on the digital release.</p><p>Naturally, Swifties immediately began decoding the lyrics to the bonus track, “The Lakes,” with many surmising that it is about the Grammy winner’s boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>. The chorus, in particular, makes several references to England, where the Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk star, 29, was born and raised.</p><p>When Swift, 30, announced on social media on July 23 that she secretly recorded Folklore in quarantine amid the COVID-19 pandemic, she told her followers that the standard edition would “have 16 songs … but the physical deluxe editions will include a bonus track.”</p><p>While fans patiently waited to hear “The Lakes,” The National member <strong>Aaron Dessner</strong>, who produced much of the album, teased what fans could expect from it.</p><p>“That’s a <a href=#><strong>Jack</strong> [<strong>Antonoff</strong>]</a> song,” he told <a href=#>Vulture</a> on July 27. “It’s a beautiful kind of garden, or like you’re lost in a beautiful garden. There’s a kind of Greek poetry to it. Tragic poetry, I guess.”</p><p>Several songs on Folklore are <a href=#>rumored to be about Alwyn</a>, whose relationship with Swift <a href=#>first made headlines</a> in May 2017. (She previously dated stars including <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Calvin Harris</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></a>.)</p><p>“Invisible String” references the “yogurt shop” where the actor worked as a teenager before becoming famous. The lead single, “Cardigan,” meanwhile, alludes to Alwyn’s 2018 movie The Favourite with the line, “And when I felt like an old cardigan / Under someone’s bed / You put me on and said I was your favorite.”</p><p>Some fans even <a href=#>speculated that Alwyn cowrote</a> the Bon Iver-featured “Exile” under the pen name William Bowery as Bowery is not a registered songwriter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift also used the album to <a href=#>announce the name</a> of <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>’s third daughter, who was <a href=#>born in 2019</a>. She later confirmed in a radio interview that “all the characters” in the song “Betty” are <a href=#>named “after my friends’ kids.”</a> (“Betty” also references the couple’s daughters James, 5, and Inez, 3.)</p><p>Scroll down to see three clues that “The Lakes” is about Alwyn!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bprrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8Fuss6loqWnopp6o7vNrqpmrKKWsKx506GcZqSRoLK0ecmonGaZnKzGr3nLsqmim6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
