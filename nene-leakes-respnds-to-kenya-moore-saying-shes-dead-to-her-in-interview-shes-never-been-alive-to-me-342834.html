She recently interviewed with Extra where she addressed her late arrival and responded to Kenya Moore’s shade.</p><p>While recently speaking about her feud with Nene, Kenya said that the Broadway star was dead to her because she tried to spit on her.</p><p>Jenn Lahmers brought up the comment during her chat with Nene who had a simple response: ‘She’s never been alive to me, so it’s fine.’</p><p>Kenya also preciously added fuel to the rumor that Leakes was suspended for putting her hands on a cameraman.</p><p>Although she admits that she did rip the crew member’s shirt, she denies that that played any part in her decision to start taping later than her co-stars.</p><p>‘Well, there was no real reason other than we were negotiating. So many people have speculated and said so many things. I even heard some of my fellow Housewives… ‘Oh, she was suspended.’ I’m like, ‘Was I? Please call Andy Cohen. Okay, because people get things misconstrued, I grabbed the camera guy’s shirt. He didn’t have a problem with it — I don’t know why anyone else does. I’ve been into a lot of things on this show and if I was going to get suspended, it sure wouldn’t have been for pulling that shirt… There have been physical altercations on our show and they weren’t suspended.’</p><p></p><p>Nene also went on to say that fans will be seeing a different side to her this season compared to any other installment of RHOA. Her husband, Gregg Leakes, was diagnosed with and beat cancer.</p><p>The sickness really changed the dynamic of their relationship and it will be something that will be explored throughout the season.</p><p>‘Listen, I have learned patience in a whole new way… A lot of things that people say doesn’t really bother me… The girls are saying certain things or they didn’t like what I said… I’m gonna say whatever I want to say ’cause they say whatever they want to say.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 p.m.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2K%2Fpr%2FPp5usZaSkeqyxzbKYZqWfpL%2BmedKasKKml2LAqbHSZpuemZRiwbB5x56pZqGeYravwMSrraKdp2LAqbHSZqWerpWneqOxxKdkmqSZq7JuwM5mpJ5lY2l%2FeX%2BTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
