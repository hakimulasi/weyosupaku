New reports from San Francisco Gate revealed that the actor actually had to have his right leg removed after suffering from coronavirus complications.</p><p>Amanda Kloots, on her Instagram account this Saturday, said that Cordero made it out of surgery intact but he had to have his leg taken off. Since then, he’s been in his room recovering and getting rest. Reportedly, doctors had to give him blood thinners to alleviate the blood clots in his leg.</p><p>Unfortunately, they took him off the treatment because it was causing internal bleeding. Had they continued giving him blood thinners, it would’ve caused more blood clotting and increase the likelihood of death. The doctor revealed it was best to take his right leg off.</p><p>As it was previously reported, Nick entered the ICU at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA on the 31st of March. Since then, he’s been on a ventilator. To quell his nervous spirit, his wife sent him daily videos of her and their 10-month-old son.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7oi9S5peMn/</p><p>Additionally, a GoFundMe fundraiser was created and it has since earned over $200,000. According to the San Fransisco Gate, Cordero is among many other Broadway actors negatively impacted by the illness, including Brian Stokes Mitchell, Danny Burstein, Aaron Tveit, and Gavin Creel.</p><p>It also killed the Tony Award-winning playwright, Terrence McNally. There’s no question that the coronavirus has struck the nation hard over the last few weeks, with cases reaching near 1 million now and over 40,000 deaths.</p><p>New York City is the epicenter of the virus at the moment, with the vast majority of cases occurring there. Other actors, entertainers, and celebrities to contract the disease include Tom Hanks, Idris Elba, Rita Wilson, Colton Underwood, Andy Cohen, and Rachel Matthews.</p><p>Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita, were among the first celebs to come out publicly and say they contracted the virus while filming a movie in Australia. It was even before the United States was locked down.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7yisNaasGarpJa%2FbrrInKJmm5Gnsaa%2BzmafmqtdobKoecCmp66skamypXnAn6ueql2YvLe1w2ZocmWUnq6ous6soKxlY22Gc4ORaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
