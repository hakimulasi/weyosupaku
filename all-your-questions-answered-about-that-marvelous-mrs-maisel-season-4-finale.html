It was an absolute nightmare to shoot that scene because I’m not kidding it was 95 degrees at two in the morning. It was some of the hottest days ever. As soon as we put the ice down on the street, it would melt. We just made it before the sun came up. It was one of those things where sometimes you want that mood and that magic and that feeling that you might be the only person alone in the world at that moment.</p><p><strong>Last question: Have you written the series finale yet? And what made you and Dan come to the decision that</strong> <a href=#><strong>season five would be the end?</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of things went into that decision. Amazon has a great say in it. They write the checks, so when they call, you have to pick up the phone, apparently. The minute that we found out that was the path forward, we really took a lot of time and a lot of care to make sure that we stick the landing because the most important thing to me is to make sure that Midge gets the send-off and the full treatment that she deserves.</p><p>So while we have not written the final episode, we know what the final image is. I have always liked doing that, the whole weird, last four words of Gilmore Girls that became this weird sort of Sasquatch urban legend thing and all anybody wanted to talk about for a long time. But for somebody like me, I need to know what my endgame is…and that helps me push toward it.</p><p><strong>I can understand that.</strong></p><p>Some people don’t like to do that. Some people just like to see where stuff takes them. I wish I could be one of those people. I think they live longer, but I kind of need to know my end game. So we know what the last image is. We don’t know what the last four words are, but we do know the image that we’re going out on. I know a lot of what’s going into the last episode, but we have a lot of people to service here. These characters deserve proper send-offs whether, it’s good, bad, and/or different.</p><p><strong>So it’s a 16-episode season then, right?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. It’s 250 episodes. So weirdly it’ll be season five, but we’ll be shooting it for the next 10 years.</p><p><strong>I was going to say, if Amazon is going to end this, then at least give us all the episodes we can possibly get.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>We will give you a lot of bang for your buck. We’re taking a really long time etching out these episodes. We’re trying to do some fun stuff that maybe people won’t really expect from us because we don’t do this kind of stuff a lot. We’re trying to savor every minute because this show is not going to happen again.</p><p>It’s that thing that happens where you work with a cast that you would work with the rest of your life and a crew that you would take a bullet for. We’re trying to make sure that we appreciate every moment.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FflrmtediorKtloaqytMDIqKWsZZGjwLix0Z6bZpmSpMK1edOhmK1lnZa%2Ft7HLqKysZZ2nwG65wKKqnqRdqLKiv86nZG1llp67orjE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
