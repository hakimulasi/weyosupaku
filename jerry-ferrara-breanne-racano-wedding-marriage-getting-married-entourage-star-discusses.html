Are you talking about marriage and kids?” Jerry revealed, “Everything you just mentioned, I foresee. I can’t say these things are discussed regularly, but they are thought about regularly.” Jerry even went as far as to discuss what kind of father he thought he would be when he and Breanne took the plunge and did have kids. The Entourage star went on to say, “I’m sure I will be a nervous one [Dad]. I was raised by a single mom and haven’t experienced a dad before. So the kid will be my top priority.”</p><p>Jerry Ferrara seems to be at an amazing place in his life with his new roommate and future wife Breanne.
