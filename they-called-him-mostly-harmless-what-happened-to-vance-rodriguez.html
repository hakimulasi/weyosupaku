Inside the tent: A dead man with no ID. For the next two years, nobody knew who he was. That mystery is the subject of the 2024 Max <strong><a href=#>true crime</a></strong> documentary <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">They Called Him Mostly Harmless</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>No one knew the real identity of the man found dead at Big Cypress, with a grey-flecked beard and kind eyes, but that didn’t mean no one recognized him. A woman named Kelly Fairbanks had seen the man before, along the Appalachian Trail, near where the body was found. As the authorities sought his real name, they released a composite sketch of what he looked like, which spread widely throughout the hiking community.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Fairbanks saw the picture and told the police she once encountered the man and was struck by his “kind aura … [H]e was joking and laughing with me … Had a beautiful smile. And he had beautiful eyes — different from any other hiker,” Fairbanks said.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>Fairbanks was so taken that she snapped a few pictures. And what was his name? According to Fairbanks, when asked the question, whomever the man was responded, “Mostly harmless,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naples Daily News</a> reported.</p><h2 id=h-mostly-harmless-was-identified-two-years-later data-injectable=false>“Mostly harmless” was identified two years later</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>via Max/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>Although Kelly Fairbanks reported she saw “Mostly Harmless” — also sometimes called “Denim” —investigators didn’t have much to go on. While there was no ID inside the tent, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there was hiking gear, about $4,000, and a couple of notebooks filled with computer code, but no cell phone or credit cards</a>. He was between 35 and 50 years old and about 5-foot-8, but he only weighed around 83 pounds. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There were no signs of foul play</a>.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Through tips and leads, the Florida investigation determined that whoever it was had been on the trail for about a year, and he had likely originated in New York state, with possible ties to Louisiana. Even though the John Doe case was widely publicized in the media, Mostly Harmless’ identity remained a mystery, but finally, more than two years after he was found, there was a break in the case.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happened to Vance Rodriguez?</h2><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>As detailed in the Max documentary, about two years after Mostly Harmless was found, an old college roommate named Randall Godso came across a picture of the unidentified hiker and told the police his name was <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vance Rodriguez</a>.</strong> According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a>, Godso said, “As soon as I saw the pictures, I knew immediately — it’s like, ‘Oh, that’s Vance!’ … A tingle ran down my spine.” Forensic DNA genealogy confirmed Godso was right.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Rodriquez was reportedly a New York tech professional from Louisiana with a troubled past, who chose to leave it all behind and vanish on the Appalachian Trail. Rodriquez’s exact cause of death <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was never determined, although he was critically underweight, according to the autopsy</a>.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>They Called Him Mostly Harmless is set to stream on Feb. 8, 2024 on Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6m1psWMnJilpJWZeqm1zGakqKukocZutMCrpKWdo6h6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2arqGWmlruksYyrpp2qmZzCpsaO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
