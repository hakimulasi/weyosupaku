He recalled taking it personally when McShane, 56, didn’t dig into her meal at the Mexican restaurant where they went for their inaugural outing.</p><p>“I apparently nauseated her, she would not touch her food, so I threw it all down,” the former Daily Show host said, noting that he finished “two giant burritos, hers and mine.”</p><p>Despite fearing that McShane “not only didn’t like me, but found me repulsive,” Stewart wasn’t quite ready to give up on the date, so he suggested they stop in at a nearby bar.</p><p>“Two shots in and she relaxes,” he told podcast hosts <a href=#><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Seth Myers</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>John Oliver</strong></a>, noting that he now knows his wife “gets very quiet” when she’s nervous. “Once she started talking and [I realized] how funny and smart she was? Oh, my God.”</p><p>Colbert, 59 — who has been friends with Stewart since they worked together on The Daily Show in the late ‘90s and early aughts — recalled reaching out to McShane after the date to hear her version of events. According to Colbert, McShane told him, “I think when he got a few drinks in me, it got me to finally speak.”</p><p>Stewart previously revealed that McShane’s roommate, whom he met while working on the 1997 film Wishful Thinking, set them up <a href=#>on a blind date</a>.</p><p>“The way she described [Tracey] was in such glowing terms, I thought, ‘Well, I’d be a jackass not to go out with this woman.’ So, I called her,” the comedian said during a 2002 appearance on Larry King Live.</p><p>When Stewart was ready to <a href=#>pop the question</a>, he recruited New York Times crossword editor <strong>Will Shortz</strong> to help him create a crossword puzzle with clues leading to the proposal.</p><p>“Crossword puzzles [are] a real bond for us,” Stewart told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Times</a> in 2006 of the romantic engagement. “It is a constant reminder that I am married to a very smart woman.”</p><p>The duo tied the knot in 2000 and welcomed <a href=#>son Nathan and daughter Maggie</a> in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Stewart and McShane also cofounded an animal sanctuary in 2015, the Hey Friend Foundation in New Jersey.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stewart’s love of animals stood out to McShane early in their relationship. During a 2015 interview with the<a href=# rel=noopener> New York Times</a>, she recalled being impressed that Stewart had inherited two cats from a past relationship.</p><p>“The fact that he got custody of the cats said so much about him,” she said. “This was my dream man.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp55iwLWx1pqprWWimrCiuMusZJ2ho5bAtbHRZp2iqqOpeqWt055ksKGknXq4tcWeZK2qkZiyunnMnKqhmZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
