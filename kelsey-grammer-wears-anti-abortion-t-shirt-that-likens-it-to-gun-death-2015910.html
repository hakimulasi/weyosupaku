A few days earlier, Kayte posed in a similar T-shirt (though hers was yellow) while wearing white shorts and oversized sunglasses.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kelsey Grammer and Kayte Walsh" width=467 height=448 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to their <a href=#>website</a>, Abort73 is “an educational website that is working to protect children from abortion.” T-shirts listed in the “gear” section of the website are retailed at $15.</p><p>Grammer has been open about his political views in the past. In a <a href=#>2011 interview with CNN</a>, the TV star admitted that he’s a “bit of a rebel” for being so openly Republican in the entertainment industry.</p><p>“I don’t tend to warm too well to people that tell me how I’m supposed to think,” he told <strong>Piers Morgan</strong> at the time. “So, my life in Hollywood — I’m afraid I was destined to be a Republican.”</p><p>He added that his pals in Hollywood “tolerate me somehow, because I can at least state myself eloquently.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The tone of political assessment has changed,” he said. “And honestly, the battle for the hearts and minds of the American people has taken on a bit more of a violent and narrow approach.”</p><p>Grammer and Kayte wed in February 2011 and share two children together — a son, <strong>Kelsey Gabriel Elias Grammer</strong>, 14 months, and a daughter, <strong>Faith Evangeline Elisa</strong>, 3.</p><p>The actor also has four other children — <strong>Spencer</strong>, 31, <strong>Greer</strong>, 23, <strong>Mason</strong>, 13, and <strong>Jude</strong>, 10 — from previous relationships, and is a grandfather to actress Spencer’s son, <strong>Emmett</strong>, 3. Married four times, he divorced his third wife, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star <strong>Camille Grammer</strong>, in 2011; their divorce was finalized just weeks before he wed Kayte.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyosrp5xquYpqWVp3q4scCrqmaZnqm2bq3BqKmtoZ%2BjerV50qGgq6xdqbWiwIyloKSdnqh6qsCMraZmn6WjeqWxwK2fZmpgZoJ6fY9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
