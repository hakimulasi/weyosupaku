To be fair, it seems critics are more… well, critical, of the film than regular audiences, but its still looking fated to join the stacked ranks of failed video game movies. It may eventually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reach the ranks of cult classic</a> among the story’s most ardent fans, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">without scares</a>, is it really Five Nights at Freddy’s?</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>One of the biggest successes in the adaptation, at least according to the story’s biggest fans, is its attention to detail. The lore behind Five Nights at Freddy’s runs deep, and only those boasting solid familiarity with the original story likely caught each of the Easter eggs and shout-outs contained within the movie. That security office? On point. As was Vanessa, a seemingly innocuous character with quite the FNAF lore behind her.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-vanessa-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s-lore data-injectable=false>Who is Vanessa in Five Nights at Freddy’s lore?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vanessa_Vanny_FNAF.jpg><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>Vanessa is, by all initial appearances, a protagonist in Five Nights at Freddy’s. She comes across as knowledgable and kind, and consistently aids Mike in his endeavors. For most audiences, she seemed like the perfect addition to the hero lineup, but there’s far more to Vanessa than meets the eye.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>See, in the complex and fascinating lore that makes up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Five Nights at Freddy’s universe</a>, Vanessa isn’t much of a hero at all. In fact, she’s among the franchise’s lineup of villains — most audiences just don’t realize it yet.</p><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>See, Vanessa was corrupted in the Five Nights at Freddy’s game by Glitchtrap, the digital virus. The virus, a remnant of the serial killer William Afton, uses Vanessa to enact its insidious will, leaving her to serve as the main antagonist in at least one FNaF game. Vanessa might seem sweet on the surface, but you won’t like her so much when Vanny comes out. Vanny, Vanessa’s villainous personality, typically dons her trademark bunny costume when glitching, which draws a clear line between her two halves.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false>There were enough teasers in Five Nights at Freddy’s — including the revelation of Vanessa’s true parentage — to make it all but certain that, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">should a sequel get the green-light</a>, Vanny will make an appearance in it. It will no doubt be interesting to see the character make the shift from her cheery, helpful personality to her dark, murderous side, and that by itself makes a solid argument for a continuation of the franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorqGnXZ7AbsLAp5ysq5Fis6rCxGalop%2BYqcBurdNmnaudlJnGtHnLqKmeZZWtva2tyKecnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
