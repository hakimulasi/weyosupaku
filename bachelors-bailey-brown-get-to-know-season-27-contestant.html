The <a href=#>Bachelor</a>’s <strong>Bailey Brown</strong> got fans’ attention with her first impression rap — but <a href=#><strong>Zach Shallcross</strong></a> didn’t catch on as quickly during their <a href=#>After the Final Rose</a> meeting.</p><p>Fans were introduced to Bailey during <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>’s season 18 <a href=#>AFTR special</a>, which aired in September 2022. The 27-year-old contestant was one of five women that <a href=#>the season 27 Bachelor</a> was introduced to live on air.</p><p>During their brief chat, Bailey shared a rhyme with Zach, 26. She told <a href=#>the California native</a> to remember the quote “on the daily, I’ll be thinking of Bailey,” but when <a href=#>the former Bachelorette contestant</a> addressed her later in the evening, he called her “Bailen.” Bailey, however, wasn’t alone as Zach forgot nearly all of the ladies’ names moments after their first encounters.</p><p>While Bailey didn’t receive <a href=#>America’s first impression rose</a> vote — <a href=#><strong>Brianna Thorbourne</strong></a> was saved by the audience ahead of the season premiere — <a href=#>she did get a little leg up on the rest of the women</a>.</p><p>“Everyone impressed me. That was incredible,” Zach said during the AFTR special. “Everyone [is] obviously beautiful, but everyone had their own way to make an impression.”</p><p>As the show’s <a href=#>leading man gets to know all of his suitors</a>, Us Weekly has fans’ go-to guide on all-things Bailey.</p><p>The executive recruiter is the “perfect combination of loving and loyal,” according to <a href=#>her ABC bio</a>. Bailey is “truly ready to settle down” but isn’t on any dating apps, because she claimed she’s “<a href=#>not looking to date around</a>.”</p><p>The new TV personality hopes to “one day own her own business in the wellness world,” per her bio, as she is “passionate” about that industry.</p><p>“She loves traveling and going on an adventure and hopes <a href=#>Zach is also looking for an adventure buddy</a>,” the bio reads. “Bailey is extremely down to earth, gets along with everyone, and hopes her future husband will bring a similar energy to their relationship.”</p><p>In early January, Bailey shared her official press photo from the season via social media — teasing her excitement over the process.</p><p>“It’s like senior year photos … except this time I’m 27 and looking for love on national television 🌹,” <a href=#>she joked in the caption</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bachelor season 27 premieres on ABC Monday, January 23, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Bailey:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXrqS0xKWmq6tdl66quMSyZJuqn6y7brPErWStp12gu7DDjKycmqufo3pzg4ycpqeslajBorrTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
