Following fashion’s biggest night, fan-favorite stars ditched their red carpet garbs for after-dark attire to attend post-<a href=#>Met Gala 2023</a> shindigs.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While Hollywood’s biggest names honored the evening’s <a href=#>“Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty Explained” theme</a> with fierce black and white gowns that paid tribute to the late designer’s love of the timeless aesthetic on the carpet — all bets were off after attendees left the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, May 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Take <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>, for example. The 27-year-old supermodel ascended the famous steps in a <a href=#>sequin bodysuit by Marc Jacobs</a>. Jenner’s ensemble was the perfect tribute to Lagerfeld as it featured a sharp collar — a look the former Chanel creative director was known for. Afterward, however, the 818 Tequila founder opted to show even more skin in a “naked” romper by Nensi Dojaka at the ApresMET Afterparty. The alluring piece featured a sparkly, sheer construction teamed with a connected high-rise thong. The garment was completed with pearl straps.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The California native hit up the soirée <a href=#>with her new beau</a>, <a href=#><strong>Bad Bunny</strong></a>, who played it cool in a white T-shirt, dark pants and cowboy boots. (The pair, who have been linked since February, walked the carpet solo.) At the Met, the “Neverita” singer, 29, looked sharp in a white textured suit by Jacquemus that was equipped with protruding flowers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a> was also present at the Apres celebration, leaving little to the imagination in a mesh corset dress. She accessorized with layers of pearls and rocked a pair of platform sandal heels by Jimmy Choo. Earlier on Monday, the My Body author looked dainty in a tulle gown by Tory Burch.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Janelle Monae</strong></a>, meanwhile, brought the heat as she hosted a Met Gala afterparty in the Boom Boom Room at the Standard Hotel. The “Yoga” artist, 37, showed off her curves in a crystal-covered black bra and coordinating underwear. While on the Met carpet, her lingerie was covered by a black pannier dress. Before showing off the structural fit, she arrived in a large black-and-white tweet Thom Browne tuxedo suit. After taking a few photos, two handlers removed the outerwear to show off her barely-there clothes. She accessorized with a feline-shaped handbag — a nod to Lagerfeld’s cat Choupette.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Keke Palmer</strong></a> danced the night away at Monae’s gathering, showing off her post-baby curves in a colorful mini dress by Sergio Hudson. She styled the flirty frock with a hot pink coat and fuchsia earrings. (The Scream Queens alum, 29, <a href=#>welcomed her first child</a> — a baby boy named Leodis —&nbsp;with boyfriend <strong>Darius Jackson</strong> in February.)&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see what the stars wore to the 2023 Met Gala afterparties:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnqtmn5Ghrm5%2Bj2tqZqOVo7GiuMtmoZ6mnpq%2Fbq3NnWSmp6KaeqS0wKeenmWWpL9urcWtnKuokafBqrHSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
