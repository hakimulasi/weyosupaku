She topped off the look with booties, futuristic shades and a super long, straight red-hair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wig</a> that was extra fierce. Then again, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen her in this hair piece.</p><p>For 2019 Halloween, the beauty mogul dressed up as a PG-13 version of Ariel from The Little Mermaid. In a seashell bra and green sequin skirt with long fiery locks, she tied together the whole, playful ensemble with a Flounder <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> that was to die for.</p><p>Other standout costumes of Jenner’s include 2018’s Barbies, which it turns out she was also loved. On October 22, Jenner posted a video to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> rating all of her costumes over the years, giving this one a 10/10. “When I do Halloween I want everything to be exact,” she explained of the over-the-top photoshoot that year. “I need everything custom. I want the exact shape of everything and exact necklace. So we had the best photoshoot.”</p><p>In 2016, she channeled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Christina Aguilera</strong></a> from the 2002 “Dirty” music video, wearing a red-and-white string <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bikini</a> with long blonde locks and even a few faux <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">piercings</a>.</p><p>“This was probably one of my first looks that I got really custom and was so excited,” Jenner explained during her YouTube video. “I still get tweets about this. My friends still talk about it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6DGrbXEZqGepp6av26w0Z6qrJ2jYsKxecCsZJplo5rFunnPqK6eql2nrq%2BzxKtkn6eiYrWiuMuorp6dnmJ%2FcX6PaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
