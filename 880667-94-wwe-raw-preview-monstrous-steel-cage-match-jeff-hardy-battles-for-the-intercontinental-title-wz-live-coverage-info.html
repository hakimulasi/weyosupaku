You may recall that the last time these two men locked up inside the squared circle, the ring literally broke.</p><p>The Hardy Boyz are appearing a little more “woken” each week, even if their Broken Universe seems to be held together by scotch tape at this point. But this week, Jeff Hardy will return to singles competition to challenge The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship, a title the “Charismatic Enigma” has held on four separate occasions previously. Jeff hasn’t had a championship singles match in WWE in over eight years, since dropping the now-defunct World Heavyweight Championship to CM Punk back in 2009.</p><p>The answer is probably YES. Last week two of the biggest stars in WWE today collided in an epic contract signing that led to one of the most talked-about segments of the year. Cena spit some of his best mic work of 2017 while Reigns… was also there! After the two attempted to outshine each other in a tag team match against the good brothers Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows, who will leave Omaha with the upper hand in this budding rivalry?</p><p>In the final moments of last week’s WWE Raw, Alexa Bliss defeated Sasha Banks to recapture the Raw Women’s Championship, continuing The Boss’&nbsp;frustrating hot-potato title career. Before the show faded to black, Nia Jax made an emphatic statement by dumping her former bestie Bliss on her back, raising the championship and staking her claim.</p><p>Last week the big news coming out of WWE for Evil Emma is that…she actually won a match. We’re not being snarky, that’s actually what they’re choosing to focus on. So what’s next for the superstar&nbsp;who helped shape NXT’s original women’s revolution?Are they ready to #GiveEmmaAChance, or is too little, too late?</p><p>&nbsp;* * * * *</p><p>Wrestlezone will have complete live coverage of WWE RAW kicking off as always at 8PM EST, with our discussion page going up two hours&nbsp;in advance. We’ll see you then!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhJdpbW9vXW6BbsPWnmSrmadivbOx1aKcsGWdpLu0wNGorKxlo6mypriMnJignV2irrWvx2ahnp6WYrWivsOyZJuZpKm5pr%2BMn6arZaSdsm61za2cq5ufo8GqusSnq5qkXam2tbjEZq6zZZyew6Z5wqitnqqRnLJutc2fpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
