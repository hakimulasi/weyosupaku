The <a href=#>ABC medical drama</a> typically doesn’t air in December, leaving fans with a month-plus sans their favorite series. Though <a href=#>this isn’t the case in 2020</a>, there will still be a couple of weeks without new episodes. Why not watch an old, Christmas-themed one instead?</p><h2><strong>‘Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer’ (Season 2)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greys-anatomy-season-2-izzie.jpg><p id=par-2_55>Izzie has a tough time after Alex cheated on her and decorates excessively for Christmas. But, at Meredith’s behest, she and the other interns spend the day helping Alex prepare to retake his boards. This is when Katherine Heigl yells one of Izzie’s best lines on the show: “Because it’s what Jesus would freaking do!”</p><p id=par-3_52>Other storylines include Burke and Cristina struggling to understand one another and their differences, a Grinch metaphor involving a boy who needs a heart transplant, and George standing up to a patient’s obnoxious family. It ends with Derek telling Addison that <a href=#>Meredith wasn’t just a fling</a>: He was in love with her.</p><h2><strong>‘Holidaze’ (Season 6)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greys-anatomy-season-6-dinner.jpg><p id=par-4_47>As insinuated by its title, this episode encompasses the holiday season, from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Day. Bailey struggles to open up about her divorce to her father, and when she does, he isn’t happy. And the <a href=#>Cristina-Teddy-Owen</a> love triangle experiences fluxations but ends in Cristina’s favor.</p><p id=par-5_54>Arguably the most heart-wrenching storyline revolves around Richard. After Meredith sees him drinking, he buys her silence by becoming her mentor. She makes excuses for him to everyone, even her dad, Thatcher, until she can’t anymore. Much of the humor comes from Mark’s teenage daughter’s arrival, though even this ends with a bomb dropping.</p><h2><strong>‘Adrift and at Peace’ (Season 7)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greys-anatomy-season-7-lexie-mark.jpg><p id=par-6_52>This episode falls in the Christmas-adjacent category. Residents Lexie, Jackson, and April compete for a surgery, which leads to a nurse asking Bailey out. <a href=#>Mark vies for Lexie’s affection</a>, and they get back together. Teddy meets Henry, a patient without insurance, and offers to marry him so he can use her benefits.</p><p id=par-7_57>After quitting episodes ago, Cristina accompanies Derek on a fishing trip, where she learns to let go of control and have patience with herself. Owen and Meredith clash over Cristina. And Arizona arrives home, apologizing to Callie, who shuts the door in her face. There are decorations and songs throughout, but it’s more about lessons than Christmas.</p><h2><strong>‘Run, Baby, Run’ (Season 9)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/greys-anatomy-season-9-bailey-wedding.jpg><p id=par-8_52>Bailey gave into Ben’s Christmas wedding, but everything that can go wrong does. Jackson and Alex double date with interns Stephanie and Jo, and both pairs grow closer than they expected. Derek’s sister, Lizzy, gives him nerves for his hand, and she and Meredith eventually bond when the latter reveals she’s pregnant.</p><p id=par-9_53>Meanwhile, Owen files for divorce, and Cristina learns he’s taking legal steps because of the plane crash, which he feels responsible for. Callie grows tired of Arizona making everything about her leg, and the two reconcile in a significant way. And Bailey doesn’t make it to her wedding because Adele needs emergency surgery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjJyfq6Gjqbqiv4yep6Krn5mytHnWmqucoF2Xsqe70Z5krKCfrHqzsdOuqaerXZ%2Bur8HAq7BnoKSiuXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
