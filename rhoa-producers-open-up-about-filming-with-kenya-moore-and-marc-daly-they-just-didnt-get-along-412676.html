The producers of the Real Housewives of Atlanta are opening up about what it was like filming with Marc Daly and his estranged wife.</p><p>In case you don’t already know, Kenya married Marc off-camera much to the dismay of Bravo network. Her omitting a monumental moment of her real-life definitely caused some tension between her and producers and it landed her in hot water with not being able to return for season 11.</p><p>With the help of Kandi Burruss, Cynthia Bailey, and her loyal fans — Kenya made her triumphant return with <a href=#>a sweet baby</a> on her hip.</p><p>Viewers were excited to get a look at her married life with the restaurateur who previously refused to film. However, it was clear that Moore’s fairytale ending was anything but.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCBP03kpZ38/</a></p><p>The few times that Daly did appear, all of his attention seemed to be on Brooklyn Daly and not Kenya. When they did have interactions, he seemed to always be criticizing his wife who appeared to be doing everything in her power to make him happy.</p><p>The night that Marc hosted an event where he <a href=#>flipped out on the camera crew</a> was the boiling point of an already tense relationship. The next day, he announced that he would be divorcing the RHOA star.</p><p>According to the Daily Dish, Marc and Kenya had deep-rooted problems that were pretty obvious from the get-go.</p><p>The Miss USA alum allegedly didn’t try to hide it because a producer claims she ‘never tried to put a positive spin on her marriage’ and she ‘was very open and honest about what was going on.’</p><p>As far as the road to divorce, showrunners explained: ‘It only got progressively worse as we continued filming. It was clear in our opinion that they just didn’t get along.’</p><p>They added that it was uncomfortable every time they filmed with the estranged couple and felt sad for the star because they knew how much she wanted her marriage to work.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=#>According to Kenya</a>, both she and Marc are in therapy to give it another try.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyiec%2Brpp2tk5q%2FtHnOqZynZaWleqKuzq6rZp6ZobqqusZmrqKsmGK4prrYmmSmp5%2Bnsm6tzZ1kppmimHqlrcuyZK2gla56q8HSrWSdoZSjwW6zxK1kmqSfo7RugJBrbXBuXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
