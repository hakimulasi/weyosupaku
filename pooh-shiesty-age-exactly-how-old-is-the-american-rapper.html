The American rapper, who is signed to Gucci Mane’s 1017 Records and Atlantic Records, began his career at the age of 19 in March 2019 when he dropped the song “Hell Night” featuring Big30. Shiesty had just begun gaining significant mainstream recognition when he was sentenced to 5 years and 3 months in prison at the age of 22.</strong></p><p>The incarcerated rapper popularized his name in the hip-hop scene in 2020 through his collaborations with other rappers. This was the year he released the single “Back in Blood” featuring Lil Durk. Back in Blood is arguably his most popular song. The following year, at the age of 21, he released his debut mixtape titled Shiesty Season.

Public records indicate he was born on the 8th of November 1999 in Memphis,&nbsp;Tennessee. He is a citizen of the United States of America and belongs to the African American ethnic group.</span></p><p><span>Pooh was born to Lontrell Donell Williams and Gladys Baines. He had a half-brother named Tarrance Henderson, who died on the 28th of February, 2021. </span><span>The rapper was raised in the Cane Creek Apartments on the south side of Memphis.</span></p><p><span>For about two years, he lived in Pflugerville, Texas, but would return to Memphis, where he attended summer school to graduate from high school. According to various reports, he began focusing more on pursuing a career in music around the age of 18.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>Pooh Shiesty Made His Debut in March 2019 at Age 19</strong></h3><p>About a year after Pooh Shiesty became serious about pursuing a music career, he made his professional debut. He accomplished this in March 2019 at the age of 19. The rapper released his debut single titled “Hell Night,” featuring his childhood friend, Big30. In February of the following year, he released the official music video of the song.</p><p>Before that, he had released his second single, titled “Shiesty Summer,” alongside its music video in August 2019. That same month, he released his second single with rapper Big30, “Choppa Talk”. Before the year ran out, precisely on the 25th of November 2019, he dropped his last song for the year, “Day One”. By the time this single was released, Pooh was already 20 years old.</p><h3><strong>He Popularized His Name in the Hip-hop Scene in 2020 at Age 20</strong></h3><p>2020 was a good year for Pooh Shiesty as it was the year he started receiving significant mainstream recognition. He was only 20 years old at this time, and the attention he gained was partly because of his several collaborations with other artists. Most of these artists had already established their names in the industry, and their popularity helped to bring Pooh to the limelight.</p><p>In May 2020, the rapper featured fellow Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo and record producer Tay Keith in the remix of his song “Main Slime,” originally released in March of that same year. His popularity soared when Gucci Mane signed him to 1017 Records and Atlantic Records in April 2020. Mane featured Pooh on his single “Still Remember,” which was released in June 2020.</p><p>The song earned Shiesty a lot of publicity, and he consolidated on that a few days later when he dropped “Monday to Sunday,” which features Big30 and the famous Atlanta rapper Lil Baby. The months that followed saw him release many collaborative songs with other up-and-coming artists who are signed to the same record labels as him.</p><h3><strong>Pooh Shiesty Released His Debut Mixtape at Age 21</strong></h3><p>At age 21, on the 5th of February 2021, the American rapper released his debut mixtape titled Shiesty Season. The mixtape released through Atlantic Records and 1017 Records featured notable hip-hop artists like 21 Savage, Lil Durk, Gucci Mane, Foogiano, and of course, Big30, amongst others.</p><p>In May 2021, the “Spring Deluxe” edition of the mixtape was released, and it featured more notable artists like Lil Baby and G Herbo. As the mixtape was making waves, it inspired the release of a “Certified” edition in April 2022. At this time, Pooh Shiesty had turned 22.</p><p>The mixtape has been certified Platinum by RIAA. When it was released, it charted on the Canadian Albums (Billboard) and peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200. It also charted and peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. At least a million copies of the mixtape have been sold thus far.</p><h2><strong>When was Pooh Shiesty sentenced to Jail?</strong></h2><p>The American rapper was sentenced to jail on the 20th of April, 2022. He was 22 when he was handed five years and three months of jail time. Earlier that year, precisely on the 4th of January 2022, it was reported that Pooh was facing up to 8 years in prison. This was after he pled guilty to federal conspiracy charges.</p><p>The Back in Blood rapper is currently serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary Pollock in Grant Parish, Louisiana. He was initially held at Turner Guilford Night Correctional Center in Miami but was later transferred to USP Pollock. His record boss Gucci Mane took to his social media pages in December 2022 to agitate that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Pooh Shiesty is being maltreated in prison</a>. Mane alleged that Pooh receives empty food trays and only gets one hour out of his cell each day.</p><p>The legal issues that landed him in prison date back to October 2020, when he was first arrested for a shooting incident in Bay Harbor Islands, Florida. He faced several charges that ranged from armed robbery to criminal theft and aggravated assault and battery. He was released the same day he was arrested but was arrested again in June 2021 for another shooting at a strip club in Miami-Dade. This time he was held in custody without bond until his trial on the 4th of January 2022.</p><p>In 2021, Pooh Shiesty was nominated for the BET HIP-HOP Awards under the Best New Hip-Hop Artist category. This and his debut mixtape, which performed well, suggest that he was on the verge of greatness when he was imprisoned. He seems to have turned a new leaf in prison, and he now advises young rappers like him to stay away from criminal activities and avoid being jailed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZL2wu8dmqqGhlajBunnAoJxmnaiWsLW42GafqK9dpLmlecisZK2glWKurrHRopqapl2nrrG8xKtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
