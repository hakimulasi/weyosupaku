The news of Yvonne’s departure at such a young age has left our tight-knit community in shock and mourning.</p><p>Yvonne’s memory will forever be etched in the annals of our club’s history, as she was an integral part of Derek’s life and our rowing family. Her unwavering support and infectious spirit have left an indelible mark on everyone fortunate enough to have known her. As we reflect on the shared moments of camaraderie and dedication on the water, Yvonne’s presence will be sorely missed, and her absence keenly felt.</p><p>Our thoughts and prayers also extend to Derek’s daughters, Lauren and Ciara, as well as the entire Bowden family during this incredibly difficult time. Losing a loved one is an unimaginable pain, and we hope that the outpouring of support from our rowing community can provide some solace during this dark period.</p><p>In the face of this profound loss, the St. Patrick’s Rowing Club Committee and Members stand united in offering our heartfelt sympathy and support to Derek and his family. May the memories of Yvonne bring comfort and strength in the days ahead. As the rowing community rallies around one of our own, we remember Yvonne for the joy she brought to our lives and the enduring impact of her spirit on our shared passion for rowing. Rest in peace, Yvonne, knowing that you will always hold a special place in the hearts of the St. Patrick’s Rowing Club family.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsMSrnKRlkqTEpbHNZqaboaSqrrPFjKacppqVp3qwsoytn55lo6l6sa3Tq6Cco6Niv7DDyKeeZpucqq9utMCsZJ2hlZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
