'Stupid.'" Padalecki <a href=#>tweeted</a> and has since deleted on Sunday, Feb. 2, according to to the <a href=#>New York Daily News</a>.</p><p>After receiving backlash from fans, the 31-year-old Supernatural actor attempted to explain his comment. "I didn't mean PSH is stupid or that addiction isn't a reality. I simply meant I have a different definition of 'tragedy,'" he wrote. "When I think 'tragedy,' I think of St Judes, of genocide, of articles I read in the paper. But, yes, either way, a death, is sad."</p><p>Padalecki wasn't the only star, however, who shared an inflammatory opinion about Hoffman's death on Twitter. Burton <a href=#>tweeted</a> Feb. 2: "Damn, #PSH was SO talented! However, if Y'all should find me dead with a needle in my arm, in my underwear . . . please put my pants on!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When one of the Reading Rainbow alum's Twitter followers wrote back "not cool, dude," Burton, 56, replied: "Not cool is shooting up when you got kids . . . #areyoukiddingme."</p><p>"No matter how you slice it, PSH wasted a great gift!" the actor added. "Lash out at me if you want to . . . I ain't goin' out like that!"</p><p>Hoffman was found dead in the bathroom of his Greenwich Village apartment with a needle in his arm. The Oscar-winning actor completed a 10-day rehab sting in May 2013 after relapsing from 23 years of sobriety. He is survived by three young children — son Cooper and daughters Tallulah and Willa — and longtime partner Mimi O'Donnell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaKasW68wJ2YpZ2ToLZuuMSvmKtlkqq%2FtbvNZqqlmZ2isqV5xaipZpufo8Gzu9WeqayhkaF6sbTIpaCpZaOaxq671KtkoaeWm7qiuoydnJqsmGLBuLHErapmamBmgXR%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
