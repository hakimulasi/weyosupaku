Absolutely. While a Naming Ceremony is secular in its origin, it is entirely the personal choice of the parents as to whether any <b>religious</b> content, from any <b>faith</b>, is included at any point.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-legally-make-someone-a-godparent></span>How do I legally make someone a godparent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1 attorney answer<p>There is no <b>legal</b> significance to <b>someone</b> being named a <b>Godparent</b>. If you want to name her as the person to be named the child’s custodian in the event of your death, you can <b>do</b> that through a will. You need to consult with a local attorney.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-make-someone-a-godparent-without-a-christening></span>Can you make someone a godparent without a christening?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Today, some parents will appoint <b>godparents</b> even <b>if</b> there is no church <b>baptism</b>. <b>Godparents</b>, whether religious or not, <b>can</b> act as role models and help guide children spiritually, emotionally and practically. Most are honoured to be asked to be a <b>godparent</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-paperwork-is-needed-to-be-a-godparent></span>What paperwork is needed to be a godparent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Those designated as <b>godparents</b> must have received the three sacraments of initiation, baptism, confirmation, and eucharist, and be living a life consistent with faith and with the responsibility of a <b>godparent</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-marry-your-godparents-child></span>Can you marry your godparents child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Also note that <b>godparents</b> cannot <b>marry</b>. The two <b>Godparents</b> cannot be <b>married</b> to each other at the time of the baptism or in the future, as the spiritual bond of the <b>Godparent</b> with the <b>child</b> being baptized supercedes any possible bond between the two <b>Godparents</b>.” May 30, 2020, 6:18pm #9.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-godparents-have-any-legal-rights></span>Do godparents have any legal rights?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Generally, only certain denominations and religions <b>have</b> use of <b>godparents</b>. Unless there is <b>legal</b> documentation that provides additional <b>rights</b>, the <b>godparent</b> is not <b>a legally</b> bound person to the family, and there is no <b>legal</b> process that can protect his or her <b>rights</b> to visitation or custody.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-undo-a-godparent></span>Can you undo a godparent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If</b> your child has already been baptized there is no way to change the <b>godparents</b> in the church’s eyes, unless the child has not received the Sacrament of Confirmation. However, <b>you can</b> legally change the <b>godparents</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-being-a-godparent-mean-legally></span>What does being a godparent mean legally?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In both religious and civil views, a <b>godparent</b> tends <b>to be</b> an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child’s upbringing and personal development, to offer mentorship or claim <b>legal</b> guardianship of the child if anything should happen to the parents.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-modern-godparent></span>What is a modern godparent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>modern</b> day <b>godparent</b> is often a family member or close friend of the parents who is chosen to be present in the child’s life in a consistent manner, and is often seen as a good role model; one who is responsible and reliable. The magnitude and meaning of the role varies from one family unit to the next.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-gods-parents></span>Who Are God’s parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>God</b> didn’t have <b>parents</b>, nor was He created. Everything that exists came from Him, but He didn’t come from anything. He has always been in existence. That’s what makes Him <b>God</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-purpose-of-a-godparent></span>What’s the purpose of a godparent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the modern baptism of an infant or child, the <b>godparent</b> or <b>godparents</b> make a profession of faith for the person being baptized (the <b>godchild</b>) and assume an obligation to serve as proxies for the parents if the parents either are unable or neglect to provide for the religious training of the child, in fulfillment of<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-godparents-get-custody-if-parents-die></span>Do godparents get custody if parents die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>godparent’s</b> role is a moral and religious one; it is the role of a ‘sponsor’ and being named as a <b>godparent</b> to a child <b>does</b> not create a legal relationship between the <b>godparent</b> and the child. <b>If</b> both a child’s <b>parents</b> were to <b>die</b> the <b>godparent</b> would not automatically <b>become</b> the child’s guardian.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-to-your-child-if-you-die-without-a-will></span>What happens to your child if you die without a will?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If</b> the parents don’t have a <b>will</b>, the <b>child</b> automatically inherits his share of the parent’s estate. The assets are then held in an estate in the minor’s name and overseen by someone appointed by the court. The <b>child</b> would have access to the account.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-both-parents-die-who-becomes-next-of-kin></span>When both parents die who becomes next of kin?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If there are no <b>kin</b> in <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> levels, then <b>the</b> deceased’s <b>parents</b> inherit. If there are no living <b>parents</b>, then siblings of either full or half-blood inherit. If there are no surviving siblings, then lineal descendants of <b>the</b> grandparents, such as nieces and nephews, become <b>the</b> beneficiaries.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-rights-does-a-godmother-have></span>What rights does a godmother have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Some people are under the impression that those who are named <b>godparents</b> automatically <b>get</b> custody if something happens to the child’s parents. However, from a legal standpoint, <b>godparents have</b> no more <b>rights</b> than any other friend or family member.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-godparents-be-family-or-friends></span>Should godparents be family or friends?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>godparent must</b> be in regular contact with the <b>family</b>. Don’t ask someone who you know will be one of those <b>godparents</b> who no one has seen for years. Being a <b>godparent</b> is both an honor and a responsibility.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-godparents-raise-the-child></span>Do godparents raise the child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The answer is “no.” A <b>godparent</b> is someone who sponsors the <b>child’s</b> baptism. This is mainly a religious role, not a legal one. The person you selected as <b>godparent</b> may not be the person you want to actually <b>raise</b> your <b>children</b> if something happens to you.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-gets-my-child-if-i-die></span>Who gets my child if I die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Only a court can legally take away parental rights. Naming a testamentary guardian in your Will does not end the other parent’s rights. The other parent will <b>get</b> custody of your <b>children if</b> you <b>die</b>, unless both these are true: The other parent is unfit.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-godparents-can-a-child-have></span>How many godparents can a child have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Traditionally, Christian <b>children have</b> three <b>godparents</b> in total, though they <b>can have</b> as <b>many</b> as the parent wants. Girls usually <b>have</b> two <b>godmothers</b> and one godfather while boys <b>have</b> two godfathers and one godmother but there is no hard and fast rules nowadays.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-both-parents-have-to-agree-on-godparents></span>Do both parents have to agree on godparents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“<b>Godparent</b>” is not a recognized legal relationship. It’s an honorary title <b>and can</b> only be given if you <b>agree</b> to <b>accept</b> it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-godparents-usually-a-couple></span>Are godparents usually a couple?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Couples</b> as <b>Godparents</b><p>Many of the people you’ll consider as <b>godparents</b> will be married or in a committed <b>relationship</b>. You’ll need to decide if you’re asking just one person from the <b>couple</b> or both people.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-have-to-sign-something-to-be-a-godparent></span>Do you have to sign something to be a godparent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If the person the parents names as <b>godmother</b> is their most trusted friend, they <b>can</b> take steps to name her as the child’s legal guardian in the event they die or are incapacitated while the child is a minor. This document <b>should</b> be <b>signed</b> by the parents and two witnesses, and the signatures <b>should</b> be notarized.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-godparents-have-to-be-male-and-female></span>Do godparents have to be male and female?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>According to Canon Law, a <b>godparent must have</b> received the three Sacraments of Initiation, be a practising Christian and be aged 16 or more. Only one <b>godparent</b> is necessary but, if there are two, Canon Law states they <b>must</b> be <b>male and female</b>, not two <b>males</b> or two <b>females</b>.
