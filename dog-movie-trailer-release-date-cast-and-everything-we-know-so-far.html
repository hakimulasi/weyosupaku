It also includes all the details related to the film’s plot, cast, trailer, and shooting schedule.</p><h2>Introduction and Brief About the Film</h2><p><span>Since appearing in Hollywood with his role as Tyler Gage in </span><b><i>Step Up </i></b><span>by Anne Fletcher, Channing Tatum has risen from Hollywood’s handsome hunk to a refined talent.</span></p><p><span>Tatum has given everything from his unforgettable acting in comedies like </span><b><i>21/22 Jump Street</i></b><span> as covert cop Greg Jenko to playing the character of a diligent male stripper in the</span><i><span> Magic Mike</span></i><span> films and even to regard fare with his role as the tormented Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz in the Oscar-elected movie </span><b><i>Foxcatcher</i></b><span>.</span></p><p><span>After withdrawing from acting for a couple of years, Tatum is back stronger with many investments awaiting in the future which also include his first directorial movie: </span><b><i>Dog</i></b><span>.</span></p><p><span>The film which is certain to evoke the sentiments of sadness and sympathy will observe Tatum venturing into unexplored situations as a director and who knows, it could turn his career into an entirely new direction. With a hectic release schedule coming in 2022, </span><i><span>Dog</span></i><span> looks like it will kickstart an amazing year for Tatum.</span></p><h2>Here’s the Film’s First Trailer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dog-Movie-Trailer-Release-Date-Cast-and-Everything-1.jpg><p><span>MGM studios released the first trailer for Tatum and Reid Carolin’s </span><b><i>Dog</i></b><span> on November 17, 2021. The trailer which is set to The Rolling Stones classic “Beast of Burden” will probably touch the hearts of dog enthusiasts everywhere as well providing us a glance at the movie’s comedic but extremely sweet mood.</span></p><h2>What Is Dog About?</h2><p><i><span>Dog</span></i><span>, as is suggestive of the title, is about a dog. Seems pretty much easy right? However in reality the movie narrates the plot of US Army Ranger Riggs (played by Tatum)&nbsp; who is summoned to handle the transport of military Belgian Malinois Lulu to the interment of her dead handler, Nuke.</span></p><p><span>While Lulu and Riggs start badly, their cross-border trip brings them nearer together and they begin to have a real connection with one another and build faith. The project is actually personal to Tatum, influenced by his own dearly deceased pet dog.</span></p><p><span>T</span><span>he dramedy looks pleasant to dog enthusiasts all around but the real question on everyone’s mind is whether the dog lives or not. We have to wait and find the answer when the film releases in the theaters but since the film looks like more of a feel-good one appealing to a lot of people, the possible answer is no.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Magpie Murders Release Date, Cast, Trailer, Plot: When Is the Britbox Series Out?</a></p><p><span>Doing that definitely won’t prevent us from crying anyway. Tatum’s longtime innovative partner Carolin will also co-direct the film, which is not anything new for those who have been constantly following the career of Tatum.</span></p><p><span>Carolyn has been assisting Tatum since the first </span><i><span>Magic Mike</span></i><span> in 2012, having written the movie and its sequel in 2015. Carolin also was an executive producer on many other films featuring Tatum like </span><i><span>22 Jump Street </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White House Down</span></i><span>.</span></p><h2>Who Else Is in Dog?</h2><p><span>Jane Adams will partner Tatum and Lulu on their trip in the character of Tamara. While the name of Adams is not much known she has appeared in many high-profile projects like </span><i><span>Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind</span></i><span>, the latest Emmy-winning HBO Max show </span><i><span>Hacks,</span></i><span> and the 2017 </span><i><span>Twin Peaks</span></i><span> revival.</span></p><p><span>Kevin Nash is also in the film after featuring with Tatum in both </span><i><span>Magic Mike</span></i><span> movies. Nash is a retired WWE wrestler who has acted in all types of films over the years including</span><i><span> John Wick </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Rock of Ages</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Dog </span></i><span>will signify his first wide-release theatrical movie since </span><i><span>Magic Mike XXL </span></i><span>of 2015.</span></p><p><span>The other cast list includes Bill Burr, Q’orianka Kilcher, Ethan Suplee, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Nicole LaLiberté, Luke Forbes, and Ronnie Gene Belvins.</span></p><h2>When Does Dog Release?</h2><p><span><i>The dog</i> was previously set to release earlier last year on February 12, 2021, but the film was postponed to a Summer release of July 16, 2021, which would have prompted it to compete against Warner Bros. live-action blockbuster </span><i><span>Space Jam: A New Legacy</span></i><span> and the horror sequel of Sony </span><i><span>Escape Room: Tournament of Champions.</span></i></p><p><i><span>The dog</span></i><span> will now release in theaters on February 18, 2022, a whole year after it was set to release. The dramedy will face serious competition that weekend because of the much-expected film of Sony, </span><i><span>Uncharted </span></i><span>featuring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, and Michael Bay’s action movie </span><i><span>Ambulance </span></i><span>featuring Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Eiza Gonzalez both release in the same weekend.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Mandalorian Season 3 Filming Reportedly Put on Pause</a></p><p><span>It is possible that MGM will postpone it for one weekend as Valentine’s Day release as it appears to be a good date movie. Releasing the previous weekend is the Jennifer Lopez-Owen Wilson romantic comedy </span><i><span>Marry Me</span></i><span> and Kenneth Branagh’s much-delayed </span><i><span>Murder On The Orient Express</span></i><span> sequel </span><i><span>Death On The Nile</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Many other significant movies are releasing that month including the eagerly anticipated sequel </span><i><span>Jackass Forever, </span></i><span>the sci-fi destruction movie </span><i><span>Moonfall</span></i><span> and Scott Derrickson’s paranormal thriller </span><i><span>The Black Phone</span></i><span>.</span></p><h2>When Did Dog Film?</h2><p><span>Initially, </span><i><span>Dog</span></i><span> was prepared to start shooting the film in mid-2020 but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the schedule had to be altered. An Instagram post by Tatum on September 21, 2020, showed that he and Carolin were in the process of filming in Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span>The production crew had to adhere to stringent guidelines to ascertain a safe and healthy set during the pandemic.</span></p><h2>Is Dog Based on a True Story?</h2><p><span><i>The dog</i> is not based on a real event, at least not which we know of. Tatum and Carolin had actually been working on the film for two years before shooting.</span></p><p><span>As stated before Tatum took motivation for his real-life bond with his own pet dog, also named Lulu. What could be a better way to start your directorial debut than to make a movie in honor of your furry friend?</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgZnxyhI6dpqBlnaTDqrGMramaoZyav26%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmmpqrpGKur7CMnq2eqqmptaq6xmaunmWbo7y4edKoZJ%2BZomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogUp - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
